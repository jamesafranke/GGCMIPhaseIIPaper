\section{Reduced specification (23-term) emulator examples}
\smallskip
\begin{flushleft}
In this section we present some parallel figures for the reduced-form emulator (23-term). 
Issues with the reduced-form model are most prominent in PROMET for rice and soy, and JULES soy and spring wheat. 
Some potential causes behind this difference in ease of emulation are as follows.
First, we do not emulate PROMET or JULES in the nitrogen dimension (CARAIB is the other model that does not do N). 
Both JULES and PROMET models are land system process models, originally developed with a broad focus, and have relatively recently (2015) been adapted for managed vegetation (i.e. agriculture).
PROMET is the most sensitive model of all the models for rice in C, T, and W. 
PROMET is the quantitatively lowest performing model for soybeans when compared to the historical FAO data for the top 10 producing countries. 
JULES is the most sensitive model of all the models for soybeans in C, T, and W. 
For spring wheat, JULES is a high outlier in C, the most sensitive model in W and T, and shows an extra inflection point in the global temperature response not seen in any of the other models. 
CARAIB on the other hand (the other model that does not do nitrogen), was originally developed as a vegetation model in the early 90's and has a longer history of agricultural focus. It is the least sensitive model in T for rice and spring wheat, and is nearest to the ensemble mean in maize and winter wheat. 
In W, it is the least sensitive model for maize, and the wheats, the second least sensitive model for soybeans, and nearest to the ensemble mean for rice. 
For C, it is the nearest to the ensemble mean for the wheats and soy and unremarkable for rice. 
However, CARAIB is the most sensitive model for maize in the C dimension (though this is relatively less sensitive than most other responses for other models the other crops).
