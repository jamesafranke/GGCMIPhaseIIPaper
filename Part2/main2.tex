\begin{abstract}
Statistical emulation of process-based crop models provides the opportunity to combine some of the advantageous features of statistical and process-based crop models.  
The Global Gridded Model Intercomparison Project (GGCMI) Phase II consists of a set of simulations run on a suit of process based models with an explicit goal of producing a uniform training dataset for crop model emulator development.
In this study we present the construction of a set of crop model emulators of mean-climatological yield for nine process-based crop models and five crops.
The GGCMI Phase II systematic parameter sweep protocol allows disentangling the climate-driven mean response from year-over-year variations; we show that the two responses have very different relationships to standard climate metrics such as mean growing season temperature. 
The climatological mean yield response can be readily represented with a simple polynomial in almost all locations where crops are currently grown, permitting a tool that captures model responses in a lightweight, computationally tractable form. 
Crop model emulation should therefore facilitate both model comparison and integrated assessment of climate impacts.

\introduction
\label{S:1}
Improving crop yield projections under future climate change is critical for global food security in the twenty-first century. 
Two distinct approaches have been applied to project future agricultural production under climate change. 
On the one hand, process-based crop simulation models (numerical models that simulate the process of photosynthesis and the biology and phenology of individual crops) provide some advantages for projecting the impacts of climate change on agriculture including providing a clear mechanism for linking climate to yield outcomes.
However, process-based models can be difficult or impossible to directly integrate into larger economic assessments due to computational constraints.  
Statistical crop models on the other hand (models developed from historical weather and yield data), lack some of the features of process-based models including future atmospheric CO$_2$ fertilization for example, but implicitly include farmer management and behavioral practices that are difficult to model explicitly. 
Additionally, statistical models typically take analytical forms that are easily implemented by downstream impact modelers. 
Both types of models continue to be used, and comparative studies have concluded that when done carefully, both approaches can provide similar yield estimates \citep[e.g.][]{Lobell2010, Moore2017, Roberts2017, zhao2017}. 
Active development of crop models is ongoing and these two approaches are becoming less district as both camps incorporate methods from the other.

Statistical emulation allows combining some advantageous features of both statistical and process-based models. 
The approach involves constructing a statistical representation or ``surrogate model'' of numerical simulations by using simulation output as the training data for a statistical model \citep[e.g.][]{OHAGAN2006, OHAGAN2010}. 
Emulation is particularly useful in cases where simulations are complex and output data volumes are large, and has been used in a variety of fields, including hydrology \citep[e.g.][]{Razavi2012}, engineering \citep[e.g.][]{STORLIE2009}, environmental sciences \citep[e.g.][]{RATTO2012}, and climate \citep[e.g.][]{Castruccio14, Holden2014}. 
For agricultural impacts studies, emulation of process-based models allows capturing key relationships between input variables in a lightweight, flexible form that is compatible with economic studies, and assists with model comparison and model evaluation efforts.

Interest is rising in applying statistical emulation to crop models, and multiple studies have developed crop model emulators in the past decade.
Early studies proposing or describing potential crop yield emulators include \citet{Howden2005, raisen2006, Lobell2010}, and \citet{Ferrise2011}, who used a machine learning approach to predict Mediterranean wheat yields. 
Studies developing single-model emulators include  \citet{Holzkamper2012} for the CropSyst model, \citet{RUANE2013a} for the CERES wheat model, and \citet{Oyebamiji15} for the LPJmL model (for multiple crops, using multiple scenarios as a training set). 
More recently, emulators have begun to be used in the context of multi-model intercomparisons, with \citet{BLANC2015, BLANC2017, Ostberg2018} and \citet{Mistry2017} using them to analyze the five crop models of the Inter-Sectoral Impacts Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) \citep{Warszawski3228}, which simulated yields for maize, soy, wheat, and rice. 
Choices differ: \citet{BLANC2015} and \citet{BLANC2017} base their emulation on historical simulations and three climate scenarios for one Representative Concentration Pathway (RPC8.5), which represents a high level of global warming; and use local weather variables and yields in their regression across soil regions; \citet{Ostberg2018} use global mean temperature change (and CO$_2$) as regressors, and then pattern-scales to emulate local yields; while \citet{Mistry2017} compare emulated and observed historical yields, using local weather data and a historical crop simulation. 
These efforts do share important common features: all emulate annual crop yields across an entire scenario or scenarios, and when projected-future climate scenarios are considered (as opposed to just historical simulations), they are non-stationary, i.e.\ their input climate parameters evolve over the course of the simulations.

An alternative approach to emulation involves the construction of a training set of multiple stationary scenarios in which input parameters are systematically varied. 
Such a ``parameter sweep'' offers several advantages for emulation over scenarios in which climate evolves over time. 
First, it allows separating the effects of different variables that impact yields but that are highly correlated in realistic future scenarios (e.g.\ CO$_2$ and temperature). 
Second, it allows making a distinction between year-over-year yield variations and climatological changes, which may involve different responses to the particular climate regressors used \citep[e.g.][]{Ruane2016}. 
For example, if year-over-year yield variations are driven predominantly by variations in the distribution of temperatures throughout the growing period, and long-term climate changes are driven predominantly by shifts in means, then regressing on the mean growing period temperature will produce different yield responses at annual vs.\ climatological timescales.  

Systematic parameter sweeps have begun to be used in crop model evaluation and emulation, with early efforts in 2014 and 2015 \citep{ruane2014, Markowski2015, Pirttioja2015}, and several recent studies in 2018 \citep{FRONZEK20182, Snyder2018, RUIZRAMOS2018}. 
All three 2018 studies sample multiple perturbations to temperature and precipitation (with \citet{Snyder2018} and \citet{RUIZRAMOS2018} adding CO$_2$ as well), in 132, 99 and 220 different combinations, respectively, and take advantage of the structured training set to construct emulators (``response surfaces'') of climatological mean yields, omitting year-over-year variations. 
All three studies focus however on a limited number of sites.
\citet{FRONZEK20182} and \citet{RUIZRAMOS2018} simulate only wheat (over many models) and \citet{Snyder2018} analyzes four crops (maize, wheat, rice, soy) for agricultural impacts experiments with the GCAM \citep{calvin2019} model.

In this paper we describe a set of globally-gridded crop model emulators developed from a new simulation output dataset as of the Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison (GGCMI) effort under the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) \citep{ROSENZWEIG2013, Rosenzweig2014}. 
This is the most comprehensive crop model emulation effort to date, expanding on previous parameter-sweep crop model emulation work by incorporating a dozen different globally gridded crop models for maize, rice, soy and wheat with as much as 40,000 years of global simulated output for a single model and crop.
Globally-gridded crop model emulators allow representing process-based crop model responses in a computationally-inexpensive form appropriate for economic assessments, and assist in crop model intercomparison and improvement efforts.
In the following sections we describe the training dataset, the emulator statistical specification, and evidence of model reliability.

\section{Methods}
\label{S:2}
\subsection{Training dataset}
The simulation output dataset that serves as the training set for the crop model emulators presented here are part of the GGCMI phase II project.
The GGCMI Phase II simulations are described in detail in Franke et al \textcolor{red}{(this issue)}, but we summarize briefly here.
The training dataset consists of the outputs from nine process-based crop models for five different crops (maize, rice, soybean, spring wheat, and winter wheat), each simulated globally at the 0.5 degree latitude and longitude resolution. 
Each simulation scenario is run for 30 years over the historic weather variability for the period of 1981-2010. 
Simulations are run for both rainfed and irrigated crops across a variety of climate and management input values (Table \ref{table:inputs}). 
In each case, the temperature and/or precipitation is offset from the historical values by either an additive mean shift or a fractional multiplier.
Atmospheric CO$_2$ and applied nitrogen fertilizer varied as well and take uniform values globally for each 30-year simulation case. 

\begin{table}[t]

W-percentage does not apply to the irrigated (W$_{inf}$) simulations, which are all simulated at the maximum beneficial levels of water. Bold font indicates the `baseline' historical level. One model provided simulations at the T + 5 level. See Figure S3 in the supplement for number of simulations associated with each combination of input levels.}

\subsection{Climatological vs. year-to-year response}

   Responses to year-over-year temperature variations (colored lines) are 100--200\% larger than those to long-term climate perturbations, rising under warmer conditions.}

\end{figure}

   \caption{Example showing climatological mean yields and distribution of yearly yields for three 30-year scenarios.

   The stronger year-over-year temperature response with higher temperatures seen in Figure \ref{fig:yearvclim} is manifested here as larger variance in annual yields even though the variance in climate drivers is identical. 
   In this work we emulate not the year-over-year distributions but the climatological mean response (dashed vertical lines).}
   \label{fig:yearly}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
   \includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{figures/pryearvclim.png}
   \caption{Example showing distinction between crop yield responses to year-to-year and climatological mean precipitation shifts. 
   Figure shows rainfed maize for a representative high-yield region (nine adjacent grid cells in northern Iowa) from the pDSSAT model, for the baseline 1981-2010 historical climate (gray) and for the scenario of maximum and minimum precipitation change (brown and green).

   Colored lines show total least squares linear regressions of year-over-year variations in each scenario. 
   Bold Black line shows the emulator fit through the climatological mean values.}
   \label{fig:yearvclimpr}
\end{figure}

We construct our emulator of 30-year climatological mean yields because most economic models project impacts at some aggregate temporal scale (decades or larger) or utilize some temporally aggregated climate projection as their input, and because the GGCMI Phase II training dataset is structured in a way that allows temporally aggregation.
The year-over-year responses are generally quantitatively distinct from (and, in the case of temperature, larger than) the climatological mean responses in the GGCMI Phase II simulation output dataset. 
In the example Figure \ref{fig:yearvclim}, responses to year-over-year temperature variations are 100\% larger than those to long-term perturbations in the baseline case, and larger still under warmer conditions, rising to nearly 200\% more in the T+6 case. 
The stronger year-over-year response under warmer conditions also manifests as a wider distribution of yields (Figure \ref{fig:yearly}).
The same general principal applies to the precipitation dimension however in this case it is more manifestly an artifact of sampling range in the historical period (Figure \ref{fig:yearvclimpr}).
Year-over-year and climatological responses can differ for many reasons including memory in the crop model, lurking covariates, and differing associated distributions of daily growing-season daily weather \citep[e.g.][]{Ruane2016}. 
Note that the GGCMI Phase II datasets do not capture one climatological factor, potential future distributional shifts, because all simulations are run with fixed offsets from the historical climatology. 
Prior work has suggested that mean changes are the dominant drivers of climatological crop yield shifts in non-arid regions \citep[e.g.][]{Glotter14}. 

We develop crop model emulators separately for yield and irrigation water demand with no growing season adaptation, and under a growing season adaptation methodology where crop phenology is allowed to vary to maintain relatively constant growing season length under the warming scenarios (so-called A0 and A1 scenarios, see Franke et al. for more details).
Emulators for irrigated simulations are separate from rainfed simulations and therefore irrigation water demand is only provided for irrigated simulations. 
Therefore, each crop model included consists of six emulators. 

\subsection{Feature engineering and regularization}
Emulation involves fitting individual regression models for each crop, simulation model, and 0.5 degree geographic pixel from the GGCMI Phase II dataset; the regressors are the applied constant perturbations in CO$_2$, temperature, water, and nitrogen (C,T, W, N).  
We regress 30-year climatological mean yields against a third-order polynomial in C, T, W, and N with interaction terms. 
We aggregate the entire 30-year run in each case to improve signal to noise ratio. 
The higher-order terms are necessary to capture any nonlinear responses, which are well-documented in observations for temperature and water perturbations (e.g.\ \citet{Schlenker2009} for T and \citet{He2016} for W). 
We include interaction terms (both linear and higher-order) because past studies have shown them to be significant effects. 
For example, \citet{Lobell2007} and \citet{Tebaldi2008} showed that in real-world yields, the joint distribution in T and W is needed to explain observed yield variance. 
(C and N are fixed in these data.) 
Other observation-based studies have shown the importance of the interaction between water and nitrogen \citep[e.g.][]{AULAKH2005}, and between nitrogen and CO$_2$ \citep{Mitsuru92, Nakamura97}. 
To limit over-fitting and unstable parameter estimation, we apply a feature selection procedure (described below) that reduces the potential 34-term polynomial (for the rainfed case) to 23 terms.

We do not focus on comparing different functional forms in this study, and instead choose a relatively simple parametric model with a polynomial basis function that allows for some interpretation of resultant parameter weights. 
Some prior studies have used other statistical specifications in crop model emulation, e.g.\ 39 term fractional polynomial in \citet{BLANC2015} and \citet{BLANC2017}, who borrow information across space by fitting grid points simultaneously across soil region in a panel regression.  % or \textcolor{red}{add in the obemaji paper?}
The relativity simple parametric form used here allows fast model emulation at the grid cell level as opposed to the global or large regional level. 
The emulation therefore indirectly includes any yield response to geographically distributed factors such as soil type, insolation, and the baseline climate, and preserves the spatial resolution of the parent models.
We hold the functional form constant in space, across all crops, and models to facilitate potential parameter-by-parameter simulation model comparison.

\begin{figure*}[ht]

   \caption{Summary results from polynomial feature selection process.

   The third row illustrates the log mean standard parameter error and the forth and fifth rows illustrate the distribution of the residuals.

   \label{fig:features}
\end{figure*}

Although the GGCMI Phase II sampled variable space is relatively large, it is still sufficiently limited that use of the full polynomial basis function described above can be problematic. 
We therefore reduce the number of terms through a feature selection cross-validation process in which terms in the polynomial are tested for importance.
In this procedure higher-order and interaction terms are added successively to the regression model one by one. 
We then calculate an aggregate mean absolute error with each increasing terms and eliminate those terms that do not contribute significant reductions (top row of Figure \ref{fig:features}). 
Some terms that did not reduce the aggregate error are included if a higher order version of that term provided a decrease in mean squared error (i.e. temperature cubed will not be included without the temperature squared term, and the linear temperature term). 
We select terms by applying the feature selection process to three example models: two that provided the complete set of 672 rainfed simulations (pDSSAT, EPIC-TAMU, and one that provided the smallest training set (130, PEPIC). 
Feature importance is not uniform due to spatial heterogeneity across models and crops, so we weight the loss function by current cultivation area during this step. 
The resulting choice of terms is then applied for all emulators and all crops. 
Since the goal of the emulator is interpolation within the sample space and not extrapolation, we air on the side of including terms that are useful in at least some cases, because the added predictive ability outweighs the costs to distribution of the residuals or over fitting.  

Feature importance is remarkably consistent across models (Figure \ref{fig:features}). 
Even though the models exhibit different absolute levels of error, all three models agree remarkably well on feature importance indicated by the terms where the error is reduced and where additional terms provide no predictive benefit (line slopes match in Figure \ref{fig:features}). 
The feature selection process results in a final polynomial in 23 terms, with 11 terms eliminated. 
We omit the N$^3$ term, which cannot be fitted because we sample only three nitrogen levels. 
We eliminate many of the C terms: the cubic, the CT, CTN, and CWN interaction terms, and all higher order interaction terms in C. 
Finally, we eliminate two 2nd-order interaction terms in T and one in W. 
Implication of this choice include that nitrogen interactions are complex and important, and that water interaction effects are more nonlinear than those in temperature. 
The resulting statistical model (Equation \ref{eqn:features_final}) is used for all grid cells, models, and rainfed crops. 
(The regressions for irrigated crops do not contain the W terms and the models that do not sample the nitrogen levels omit the N terms).

To fit the parameters $K$, we use a Bayesian Ridge regularization method \citep{MacKay91}, which reduces volatility in parameter estimates when the sampling is sparse, by weighting parameter estimates towards zero. 
This results in a reduction in mean absolute error for some of th high-order interaction terms in the model (top row of Figure \ref{fig:features}) and drastically reduces standard parameter error in the model by stabilizing the estimates.
The Bayesian Ridge method is necessary over the OLS to maintain a consistent functional form across all models and locations (see Table \ref{table:ASE}). 
The Bayesian Ridge estimation method scores relatively lower on adjusted R$^2$ (equation \ref{eqn:rsquare}, where n is the number of samples and k is the number of features) for the simplest parameter specifications, but reaches parity with the OLS at the number of terms included in this study.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:rsquare}
    R^{2}_{adj} = 1 - \frac{(n-1) \cdot (1 - R^{2})}{n - k}
\end{equation}

The distribution of the residuals depends on the number of features included in the regression, the method for estimating the parameters, and the target distribution in the training set. 
Including additional higher order terms in the model tends to reduce the skew in the residuals in most cases.
The residuals are only normally distributed (Shapiro–Wilk test \citep{Shapiro1965} pvalue > 0.05) for one of the crop models shown in Figure \ref{fig:features} for any specification tested.
The EPIC-TAMU and pDSSAT crop module emulator residuals are never normally distributed by this metric for any feature specification proposed here. 

We use the implementation of the Bayesian Ridge estimator from the scikit-learn package in Python \citep{scikit-learn}. 
In the GGCMI Phase II experiment, the most problematic fits are those for models that provided a limited number of cases or for low-yield geographic regions where some modeling groups did not run all scenarios. 
We do not attempt to emulate models that provided less than 50 simulations. 
The lowest number of simulations emulated across the full parameter space is then 130 (for the PEPIC model). 
The yield output for a single GGCMI Phase II model that simulates all scenarios and all five crops is $\sim$12.5 GB; the emulator is $\sim$20 MB, a reduction of nearly three orders of magnitude.

Model emulation with the parametric method proposed here is only possible when crop yield responses are sufficiently smooth and continuous to allow fitting with a relatively simple functional form, but this condition largely holds in the GGCMI Phase II simulations. 
Responses are quite diverse across locations, crops, and models, but in most cases local responses are regular enough to permit emulation. 
Geographic diversity is high within a single crop and model (Figure \ref{fig:regression} rainfed maize in pDSSAT); this heterogeneity supports the choice of emulating at the grid cell level. 
Each panel in Figure \ref{fig:regression} shows simulated yield output from scenarios varying only along a single dimension (CO$_2$, temperature, precipitation, or nitrogen addition), with other inputs held fixed at baseline levels, compared to the full 4D emulation across the parameter space. 
Yields evolve smoothly across the space sampled, and the polynomial fit captures the climatological response to perturbations. 
Crop yield responses generally follow similar functional forms across models, though with a large spread in magnitude partly due to the lack of calibration. 
Inter-model diversity for a single crop and location is also high (Figure \ref{fig:regression_iowa}, rainfed maize in northern Iowa, also shown in Figure \ref{fig:regression}). 
Differences in response shape can lead to  differences in the fidelity of emulation, though comparison here is complicated by the different simulation experiment sampling regimes across models. 
Note that models are most similar in their responses to temperature perturbations. 

While the nitrogen dimension is important, it is also the most problematic to emulate in this work because of its limited sampling compared to other dimensions. 
The GGCMI Phase II protocol specified three nitrogen levels (10, 60 and 200 kg~N y$^{-1}$ ha$^{-1}$), so a third-order fit would be over-determined but a second-order fit can result in potentially unphysical results. 
Steep and nonlinear declines in yield with lower nitrogen levels mean that some regressions imply a peak in yield between the 100 and 200 kg~N y$^{-1}$ ha$^{-1}$ levels. 
While it is possible that over-application of nitrogen at the wrong time in the growing period could lead to reduced yields, these relative strength of this feature is are potentially an artifact of the fit. 
The Bayesian Ridge estimator tends to mitigate the `peak-decline effect' compared to ordinary least squares. 
In addition, the polynomial fit cannot capture the well-documented saturation effect of nitrogen application \citep[e.g.][]{Torsten77} as accurately as would be possible with a non-parametric model. 

No general criteria exist for defining an acceptable crop model emulator, so we present two different metrics. 
First, for a multi-model comparison exercise like GGCMI Phase II, one reasonable criterion is what we term the ``normalized error'', which compares the fidelity of an emulator for a given model and scenario to the inter-model uncertainty. 
We define the normalized error $e$ for each scenario as the difference between the fractional yield change from the emulator and that in the original simulation, divided by the standard deviation of the multi-model spread (Equations \ref{eqn:per_yield} and  \ref{eqn:error}):

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:per_yield}
    F_{\: scn.}=\frac{Y_{scn.}-Y_{baseline}}{Y_{baseline}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:error}
    e_{\: scn.} =\frac{F_{em, \: scn.}-F_{sim, \: scn.}}{\sigma_{sim, \: scn.}}
\end{equation}

Here $F_{\: scn.}$ is the fractional change in a model's mean emulated or simulated yield from the defined historical baseline, in a certain setting or scenario (scn.) in C, T, W, and N space; $Y_{scn.}$ and $Y_{baseline}$ are the absolute emulated or simulated mean yields. 
The normalized error $e$ is the difference between the emulated fractional change in yield and that actually simulated, normalized by $\sigma_{sim}$, the standard deviation in simulated fractional yields change $F_{sim,\: scn.}$ across all models. 
The emulator is fitted across all available simulation outputs for each grid cell, model, and crop, and then the error is calculated across the each of the simulation scenarios provided by all nine models (Figure S3). 

This metric implies that emulation is generally satisfactory, with several distinct exceptions. 
Almost all model-crop combination emulators have normalized errors less than one over nearly all currently cultivated hectares (Figure \ref{fig:error}), but some individual model-crop combinations are difficult to emulate (e.g.\ PROMET for rice and soy, JULES for soy and spring wheat, Figures S24-S25). 
Problems with emulating PROMET for rice and soy may have to do with the parametrization of the phenology for those crops which lengthens the growing season in some cases. 
Normalized errors for soy are somewhat higher across all models not because emulator fidelity is worse but because models agree more closely on yield changes for soy than for other crops (see Figure S18), lowering the denominator. 
Emulator performance often degrades in geographic locations where crops are not currently cultivated. 
For example, emulator performance may be satisfactory over cultivated areas for all crops, but uncultivated regions may show some problematic areas (Figure \ref{fig:error} shows a CARAIB model case, see also Figure S26).

This first assessment procedure is relatively forgiving for several reasons. 
First, each emulation is evaluated against the simulation actually used to train the  (in-sample validation). 
Had we used a spline interpolation the error would necessarily be zero. 
Second, the performance metric scales emulator fidelity not by the magnitude of yield changes but by the inter-model spread in those changes. 
The normalized error $e$ for a model depends not only on the fidelity of its emulator in reproducing a given simulation but on the particular suite of models considered in the intercomparison exercise. 
Where models differ more widely, the standard for emulators becomes less stringent. 
This effect is readily seen when comparing assessments of emulator performance in simulations at baseline CO$_2$ (Figure \ref{fig:error_360}) with those at higher CO$_2$ levels (Figure S27) because models disagree on the magnitude of CO$_2$ fertilization. 
The rationale for this choice of assessment metric is to relate the fidelity of the emulation to an estimate of true uncertainty, which we take as the multi-model spread. 
We therefore do not provide a formal parameter uncertainty analysis, but note that the GGCMI Phase II dataset is well-suited to statistical exploration of emulation approaches and quantification of emulator fidelity. 
More rigorous emulator assessments that could be preformed in future work include: testing other statistical specifications including non-parametric models and calculating standard error on emulator parameters.

We also provide a more stringent test of emulator performance; a three-fold cross validation (out-of-sample validation). 
Here the training data is split and the model is trained on two thirds of the data and tested on the held out portion (the process is then repeated three times to cover all data in the training set). 
We normalize the error in each grid cell by dividing by the yield in that grid cell in the baseline (T+0, W+0, C=360, N=200) case and show aggregations by grid cell and weighted by area cultivated per grid cell. 
Errors are generally low as a percentage of yield --even for this strict protocol-- and when weighted by area, essentially zero in most cases (Table \ref{table:ASE}). 
Note that the cross validation process often does not include ``edge'' simulations in the training set (i.e. those at the highest or lowest value in that dimension) on one or more folds of the training set split.
The ``edge'' cases are then predicted during the prediction phase of cross validation.
Such an extrapolation during cross validation is not representative based on the intended use of the emulator, which should only be used within the sample space of the overall training set.

%The emulation fidelity demonstrated here is sufficient to allow using emulated response surfaces to compare model responses and derive insight about impacts projections.

    \caption{Global emulated damages for maize on currently cultivated lands for the GGCMI Phase II models emulated, for uniform temperature shifts with other inputs held at baseline. 
    (The damage function is created from aggregating up emulated values at the grid cell level, not from a regression of global mean yields.) 
    Lines are emulations for rainfed (solid) and irrigated (dashed) crops; for comparison, dots are the simulated values for the rainfed case.  
    For most models, irrigated crops show a sharper reduction than rainfed because of the locations of cultivated areas: irrigated crops tend to be grown in warmer areas where impacts are more severe for a given temperature shift (the exceptions are PROMET, JULES, and LPJmL, see Franke et al. this issue for more details). 
    For other crops and scenarios see Figures S18-21 in the supplemental material.}
    \label{fig:globe_em}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure*}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=15cm]{figures/em_CTWN_all_crops.png}
  \caption{Emulated global damage functions for the five crops included in GGCMI Phase II, from the multi-model mean, for the four dimensions varied: CO$_2$, temperature, water, and nitrogen (collectively ``CTWN''). 
  Solid line shows single-dimension damages and shaded area shows the spread resulting from changes in all four (CTWN) dimensions.
  For single-dimension damages, all other covariates held constant at baseline values (T+0K, W+0\%, C = 360ppm, and N = 200kg ha-1). Damages are reported as fractional change in production relative to the baseline case.}
  \label{fig:all_dims}
\end{figure*}

Because the emulator or ``surrogate model'' transforms the discrete simulation sample space into a continuous response surface at any geographic scale, it can be used for a variety of applications, including construction of continuous damage functions. 
As an example, we show a damage function constructed from the 4D emulation, aggregated to global yield, with simulated values shown for comparison (Figure \ref{fig:globe_em}, which shows maize on currently cultivated land; see Figures S18 - S21 for other crops and dimensions). 
The emulated values closely match simulations even at this aggregation level.

Finally, we present global damage functions across all four dimensions tested in this study (Figure \ref{fig:all_dims}). 
In general, across model spread is qualitatively similar across different crops and different dimensions with some notable exceptions. 
Model spread is highest for spring wheat in general and for the CO$_2$ response for the wheats and soy.
On the other side, muted responses include soy, an efficient atmospheric nitrogen-fixer, is relatively insensitive to nitrogen, and rice is not generally grown in water-limited conditions so shows the lowest response to changes in precipitation. 

Note that these functions are presented only as examples and do not represent true global projections, because they are developed from simulation data with a uniform temperature shift while increases in global mean temperature should manifest non-uniformly in space and distributions \citep[e.g]{Sippel2015}. 
The global coverage of the GGCMI Phase II simulations allows impacts modelers to apply arbitrary geographically-varying climate projections, as well as arbitrary aggregation masks, to develop damage functions for any climate scenario and any geopolitical or geographic level bigger than 0.5 degrees in latitude and longitude.

\section{Discussion and Conclusions} 
\label{S:5}
We show that the systematic parameter sampling in the GGCMI Phase II experiments allow emulating climatological crop yield responses with a relatively simple reduced-form statistical model. 
The sampling provides information on the influence of multiple interacting factors in a way that realistic climate model simulations cannot, and allows isolating long-term impacts from confounding factors that lead to different year-over-year responses. 
The use of a relatively simple functional form in turn offers the possibility of physical interpretation of parameter values that can assist in model intercomparison and evaluation. 

Several cautions should be noted when using the emulator. While the emulator allows estimating agricultural impacts under arbitrary climate scenarios, extrapolation outside the sample space should be avoided. 
Additionally, because the simulation protocol was designed to focus on change in yield under climate perturbations and not on replicating real-world yields, the models are not formally calibrated so cannot be used for impacts projections except in conjunction with historical yield information. 
Finally, because the GGCMI Phase II simulations apply uniform perturbations to historical climate inputs, they do not sample potential changes in climate variability. 
Although such changes are uncertain and remain poorly characterized \citep[e.g.][]{Alexande2006, Kodra2014}, follow-up experiments may wish to consider them. 
Several recent studies have described procedures for generating simulations that combine historical data with model projections of changes in the marginal distributions or temporal dependence of temperature and precipitation(e.g.\ \citet{Leeds2015, poppick2016, Won16} and \citet{Haugen2018}).

The GGCMI Phase II dataset invites a broad range of potential future avenues of analysis, especially because emulation allows statistical distillation of the large dataset (40 billion simulated yields) into a tractable form. 
Potential studies might include a detailed examination of interaction terms between the major input drivers, robust quantification of model sensitivities to input drivers, exploration of yield responses to extremes, and evaluation of geographic shifts in optimal growing regions. 
The dataset also enables studies of emulation itself, including a more systematic evaluation of different statistical and machine learning model specifications.
In general, the development of multi-model ensembles involving systematic parameters sweeps has large promise for better understanding potential future crop responses and for improving process-based crop models.
