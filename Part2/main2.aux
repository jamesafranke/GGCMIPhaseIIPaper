Panels show simulated (black) and emulated (red) global production for four crops from the LPJmL model, driven with temperature and precipitation outputs from the HadGEM2-ES climate model for the RCP8.5 scenario. In both cases nitrogen and CO$_2$ are held fixed, at 200 kg ha$^{-1}$ and 360 ppm. Points show yearly global production change from the 1981-2010 baseline, and lines show a 10-year running mean. See text for discussion of relating the HadGEM2-ES temperature timeseries to the appropriate offset used in emulation. Emulators trained on uniform climatological offsets reproduce well the simulated production response under a realistic climate scenario: yields at end of century match to within 1.5\%. \relax }{figure.caption.12}{}}

Figure shows emulated yield changes (relative to 1981-2010) for maize (both rainfed and irrigated) on currently cultivated land under RCP8.5 climate projections from three representative CMIP5 climate models ((HadGEM2-ES, GFDL-ESM2M, and IPSL-CM5A-LR), using changes to T only (\textbf  {a}), to T and W (\textbf  {b}), and to T, W, and C (\textbf  {c}). The x-axis is the mean growing-season temperature change over cultivated land, computed using the historical growing season; note that these values will be higher than the corresponding global mean temperature change. Dots are emulated yearly global production changes to 2100 (90 years $\times $ 5 climate timeseries = 450 per crop model), with x-axis the mean historical growing-season T shift over all grid cells where maize is grown (unweighted by within-cell cultivated area). \textbf  {a:} Using only temperature changes allows comparing regional simulated and emulated values. Open squares are GGCMI Phase~2 simulated values for each T level, with CWN held at baseline; bold lines are emulated values over uniform $\Delta $T shifts (repeated in each panel). Emulation uncertainty (compare squares to lines) is small relative to differences across climate and crop models, and mean yield changes are similar whether T changes are applied as a uniform shift or in a more realistic spatial pattern (compare lines to dots). \textbf  {b:} Adding in precipitation changes increases yield spread across climate projections and depresses yield slightly. No squares are shown in \textbf  {b} because the GGCMI uniform offsets of both T and W are not directly comparable to GCM-specific changes of T and W in a climate projection. \textbf  {c:} CO$_2$ fertilization is small in pDSSAT, moderate in LPJmL, and very large in PROMET. The separation of groups of points in PROMET (gold) results because CMIP5 climate sensitivities differ by nearly a factor of two; points at far right are under the highest-sensitivity model, HadGEM2-ES.
