Figure shows emulated yield changes (relative to 1981-2010) for maize (both rainfed and irrigated) on currently cultivated land under RCP8.5 climate projections from 5 representative CMIP-5 climate models, using changes to T only (\textbf  {a}), to T and W (\textbf  {b}), and to T, W, and C (\textbf  {c}). X-axis is the mean growing-season temperature change over cultivated land, computed using the historical growing season; note these values will be higher than the corresponding global mean temperature change. Dots are emulated yearly global production changes to 2100 (90 years $\times $ 5 climate timeseries = 450 per crop model), with x-axis the mean historical growing-season T shift over all grid cells where maize is grown (unweighted by within-cell cultivated area). \textbf  {a:} Using only temperature changes allows comparing regional simulated and emulated values. Open squares are GGCMI Phase 2 simulated values for each T level, with CWN held at baseline; bold lines are emulated values over uniform delta T shifts (repeated in each panel). Emulation uncertainty (compare squares to lines) is small relative to differences across climate and crop models, and mean yield changes are similar whether T changes are applied as a uniform shift or in a more realistic spatial pattern (compare lines to dots). \textbf  {b:} Adding in precipitation changes increases yield spread across climate projections and depresses yield slightly. \textbf  {c:} CO$_2$ fertilization is small in pDSSAT, moderate in LPJmL, and very large in PROMET. The separation of groups of points in PROMET (gold) results because CMIP-5 climate sensitivities differ by nearly a factor of two; points at far right are under HadGEM2-ES. \textcolor {red}{No squares are shown in panel {b.} because no directly comparable simulations are available with both T and W changing under an RCP.} In RCP8.5, the 30-year-average CO$_2$ at end of century is 807 ppm \citep  {riahi2011rcp}.
