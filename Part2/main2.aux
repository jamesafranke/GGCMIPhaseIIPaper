In general the climatological response surface is sufficiently smooth that it can be represented within the sampled variable space by the simple polynomial used in this work. In some cases extrapolation would produce misleading results, and the emulator fails in conditions where yield response changes abruptly. Failure is illustrated here by rainfed maize in north-central Ontario for the PROMET model (in gray), which shows present-day yields of zero rising abruptly if temperature warms by 4 degrees. \relax }{figure.caption.7}{}}
