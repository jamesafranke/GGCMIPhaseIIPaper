\begin{abstract}
Concerns about food security under climate change motivate efforts to better understand future changes in crop yields.  
Process-based crop models, which represent plant physiological and soil processes, are necessary tools for this purpose since they allow representing future climate and management conditions not sampled in the historical record and new locations to which cultivation may shift. 
However, process-based crop models  differ in many critical details, and their responses to different interacting factors remain only poorly understood. 
The Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison (GGCMI) Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 }\DIFaddend experiment, an activity of the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP), is designed to provide a systematic parameter sweep focused on climate change factors and their interaction with overall soil fertility, to allow both evaluating model behavior and emulating model responses in impact assessment tools.
In this paper we describe the GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 }\DIFaddend experimental protocol and its simulation data archive. 
Twelve crop models simulate five crops with systematic uniform perturbations of historical climate, varying CO$_2$, temperature, water supply, and applied nitrogen (``CTWN'') for rainfed and irrigated agriculture, and a second set of simulations represents a type of adaptation by allowing the adjustment of growing season length.
We present some crop yield results to illustrate general characteristics of the simulations and potential uses of the GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 }\DIFaddend archive. 
For example, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in cases without adaptation, }\DIFaddend modeled yields show robust decreases to warmer temperatures in almost all regions, with a nonlinear dependence that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{indicates }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{means }\DIFaddend yields in warmer baseline locations have greater temperature sensitivity. 
Inter-model uncertainty is qualitatively similar across all the four input dimensions, but is largest in high-latitude regions where crops may be grown in the future.

\introduction
\label{S:1}
Understanding crop yield response to a changing climate is critically important, especially as the global food production system will face pressure from increased demand over the next century \citep{Foley2005,bodirsky2015}. 
Climate-related reductions in supply could therefore have severe socioeconomic consequences \citep[e.g.][]{Stevanovic2016,Wiebe_2015}. 
Multiple studies using different crop or climate models concur in projecting sharp yield reductions on currently cultivated cropland under {business-as-usual} climate scenarios, although their yield projections show considerable spread \citep[e.g.][and references therein]{Rosenzweig2014, Schauberger2017, porter2014}. 
Although forecasts of future yields reductions can be made with simple statistical models based on regressions in historical weather data, process-based models, which simulate the effect of temperature, water and nutrient availability, and atmospheric CO2 concentration on the process of photosynthesis and the biology and phenology of individual crops, play a critical role in assessing the impacts of climate change.

Process-based models are necessary for understanding crop yields in novel conditions not included in historical data, including higher CO$_2$ levels, out-of-sample combinations of rainfall and temperature, cultivation in areas where crops are not currently grown, and differing management practices \citep[e.g.][]{pugh_climate_2016, Roberts2017,minoli2019modelling}. Process-based models have therefore been widely used in studies on future food security \citep{wheeler2013climate, Elliott14, frieler2017assessing}, options for climate mitigation \citep{muller2015} and adaptation \citep{challinor2018improving}, and future sustainable development \citep{humpenoder2018large, jagermeyr_reconciling_2017}.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Process-based models also allow for the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{They are a necessity for }\DIFaddend global gridded simulations\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{needed for }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, which allow }\DIFaddend understanding the global dynamics of agricultural trade, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{including cultivation area changes and crop selection switching under climate change \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

}\DIFdelend because global market mechanisms \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{may strongly modulate climate change impacts }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{can strongly modulate the economic impacts of regional yield changes }\DIFaddend \citep{Stevanovic2016,hasegawa2018risk}. 
Global \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{crop model experiments are needed for systematic climate change  assessments \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{muller_global_2017}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{simulations are especially necessary in studying agricultural effects of climate change  \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{muller_global_2017}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
, since systematic climate assessments must account for cultivation area changes and crop selection switching \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{rosenzweig2018,ruane2018} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
and must consider inter-regional differences \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[e.g.][]{Nelson2014, Wiebe_2015}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend .

Modeling crop responses, however, continues to be challenging, as crop growth is a function of complex interactions between climate inputs, soil, and management practices \citep{Boote13,rotter2011}. 
Models tend to agree broadly in major response patterns, including a reasonable representation of the spatial pattern in historical yields of major crops and projections of shifts in yield under future climate scenarios \citep[e.g.][]{Elliott2015, muller_global_2017}. 
But process-based models still struggle with some important details, including reproducing historical year-to-year variability in many regions \citep[e.g.][]{muller_global_2017, Jag2018}, reproducing historical yields when driven by reanalysis weather \citep[e.g.][]{Glotter14}, and low sensitivity to extreme events \citep[e.g.][]{Glotter15,schewe2019}. 
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Global models pose additional challenges due to variable input data quality and limited ability for model calibration.
}\DIFaddend Long-term projections therefore retain considerable uncertainty \citep{WOLF2002217, JAGTAP200273, Iizumi2010, ANGULO201332, Asseng2013, Asseng2015}. 

Model intercomparison projects such as the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project \citep[AgMIP, ][]{ROSENZWEIG2013} are crucial in quantifying uncertainties in model projections \citep{Rosenzweig2014}. Intercomparison projects have also been used to develop protocols for evaluating overall model performance \citep{Elliott2015, muller_global_2017} and to assess the representation of individual physical mechanisms such as water stress and CO$_2$ fertilization \citep[e.g.][]{Schauberger2017}.
However, to date, few such projects have systematically sampled critical factors that may interact strongly in affecting crop yields. 
A number of modeling exercises in the last five years have begun to use systematic parameter sweeps in crop model evaluation and emulation \citep[e.g.][]{ruane2014, Markowski2015, Pirttioja2015,FRONZEK20182, Snyder2018, RUIZRAMOS2018}, but all involve limited sites and most also limited crops and scenarios. 
%DIF > Climate change does not only affect overall temperature and precipitation levels, but also their distribution within growing seasons \citep[e.g.][]{Holmes2016}.  While crop model simulations based on climate projections from climate models as e.g. from the CMIP \citep[Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, see][]{Eyring2016} archive as used by \citet[e.g.][]{Rosenzweig2014} can more realistically inform climate change impact assessments, an analysis of model sensitivities and response types is hampered by such non-systematic experiments.  The GGCMI Phase 2 experiment is designed for scrutinizing model behavior and sensitivities as well as for crop model emulator design and does not fully replace crop model simulations with sophisticated climate scenarios. 

The Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison (GGCMI) Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 }\DIFaddend experiment is the first global gridded crop model intercomparison involving a systematic parameter sweep across critical interacting factors.

In this paper, we describe the GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 }\DIFaddend model experiments and present initial summary results.
In the sections that follow, we describe the experimental goals and protocols; the different process-based models included in the intercomparison; the levels of participation by the individual models. We then provide an assessment of model fidelity based on observed yields at the country level, and show some selected examples of the simulation output dataset to illustrate model responses across the input dimensions.

\section{Simulation objectives and protocol}
\label{S:2}
\subsection{Goals}

The guiding scientific rationale of GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 }\DIFaddend is to provide a comprehensive, systematic evaluation of the response of process-based crop models to critical interacting factors, including CO$_2$, temperature, water, and applied nitrogen under two contrasting assumptions on growing season adaptation (CTWN-A). 
The dataset is designed to allow researchers to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Enhance understanding of models \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{’ }\DIFdelend sensitivity to climate and nitrogen drivers.
    \item Study the interactions between climate variables and nitrogen inputs in driving modeled yield impacts. 
    \item Characterize differences in crop responses to climate change across the Earth's climate regions.
    \item Provide a dataset that allows statistical emulation of crop model responses for downstream modelers.
    \item Explore the potential effects on future yield changes of adaptations in growing season length.
\end{itemize}

  \label{fig:crop_area}
\end{figure*}

The GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{I }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1 }\DIFaddend intercomparison was a relatively limited computational exercise, requiring yield simulations for 19 crops across a total of 310 model-years of historical scenarios, and had the participation of 14 modeling groups.
The GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 }\DIFaddend protocol is substantially larger, involving over 1400 individual 30-year global scenarios, or over 42,000 model-years; 12 modeling groups nevertheless participated. To reduce the computational load, the GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 }\DIFaddend protocol reduces the number crops to 5 (maize, rice, soybean, spring wheat, and winter wheat). 
The reduced set of crops includes the three major global cereals and the major legume and accounts for over 50\% of human calories in 2016: nearly 3.5 billion tons or 32\% of total global crop production by weight \citep{FAOSTAT}. 
This set of major crops has the advantage of historical yield data globally available at sub-national scale \citep{Ray2012,iizumi_historical_2014}, and has been frequently used in subsequent analyses \citep[e.g.][]{muller_global_2017,porwollik_spatial_2016}.

The Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 }\DIFaddend protocol involves a suite of uniform perturbations from a historical climate timeseries.
The baseline climate scenario for GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 }\DIFaddend is one of the weather products used in Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{I}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1}\DIFaddend , daily climate inputs for 1980-2010 from the 0.5 degree NASA AgMERRA (``Agricultural''-modified Modern Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications) gridded re-analysis product. AgMERRA is specifically designed for agricultural modeling, with satellite-corrected precipitation \citep{Ruane2015}. 
The experimental protocol consists of 9 levels for water supply perturbations, 7 for temperature, 4 for CO$_2$, and 3 for applied nitrogen, for a total of 756 simulations (Table \ref{table:inputs}), 672 for rainfed agriculture and an additional 84 for irrigated (W$_{\infty}$).  
%DIF < For irrigated simulations, models are set to apply near-perfect irrigation to keeps soils wet throughout the entire growing period, with no limitations in water supply. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In irrigated simulations, crops are assumed to have no water constraints, i.e. all crop water requirements are fulfilled regardless of local water supply limitations.
Given that the irrigated scenario (W$_{\infty}$) is one element of the water supply levels, irrigated simulations use the same growing seasons and areas as all other simulations.
All other water supply levels are implemented as relative variations of precipitation.
}\DIFdelend Values of climate variable perturbations are selected to represent reasonable ranges for changes over the medium term (to 2100) under business-as-usual emissions. 
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Values for nitrogen application levels are intended to cover a wide range of potentials. }\DIFaddend The resulting GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II dataset therefore }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 dataset }\DIFaddend captures the distribution of crop model responses over \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a wide }\DIFaddend range of potential future climate \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and management }\DIFaddend conditions.

The irrigated scenario (W$_{\infty}$) is a particular case of water supply levels, in which crops are assumed to have no water constraints. That is, all crop water requirements are fulfilled regardless of local water supply limitations.
 To facilitate comparison, irrigated simulations use the same growing seasons as all other simulations, even though in reality irrigated growing seasons may be different \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

}

\DIFadd{The uniform perturbations of the GGCMI Phase 2 protocol require some care in interpretation. Temperature and precipitation perturbations should be considered as differences from historical climatology within the growing season only.

In a realistic climate projection, higher latitudes generally warm more strongly than lower latitudes \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

The GGCMI Phase 2 simulations are intended to be used for climate impact assessment not directly but instead as a ``training set'' for statistical emulation of each crop model. Once an emulator is constructed from the outputs described here, it can be driven with growing-season climate anomalies from any climate model projection.  The GGCMI Phase 2 protocol does not involve any simulated changes in climate variability, but
\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Franke2020} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
demonstrate that these effects are relatively minor and that GGCMI Phase 2 emulators can effectively reproduce crop model yields under realistic future climate scenarios.

The procedure follows that proposed by \citet{pugh_climate_2016}. 
All modeling groups simulate the minimum required coverage, but some provide simulations that extend into masked zones, including e.g.\ the Sahara Desert and Central Australia (Figure \ref{fig:crop_area}, right).

\subsection{Harmonization between models}
The 12 models included in GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 }\DIFaddend are all process-based crop models that are widely used in impacts assessments (Table \ref{table:models}).
Although some models share a common base (e.g.\ the LPJ \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{family or the EPIC family }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{or EPIC families }\DIFaddend of models), they have subsequently developed independently.  
Wherever possible, the GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 }\DIFaddend protocol harmonizes inputs, but differences in model structure mean that several key factors cannot be fully standardized across the experiment. 
These include soil treatment (which affects soil organic matter and carry-over effects of soil moisture across growing years) and baseline climate inputs.  

While 10 of the 12 models participating in GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 }\DIFaddend use the AgMERRA historical daily climate data product, two models require sub-daily input data and thus use different baseline climate inputs:
PROMET uses ERA-Interim reanalysis \citep{dee2011era}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, and }\DIFaddend JULES uses a bias-corrected version of ERA-Interim, the 3-hour WFDEI (WATCH-Forcing-Data-ERA-Interim) \citep{weedon2014wfdei}, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{selecting }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{specifically the }\DIFaddend WFDEI version with precipitation bias-corrected against the CRU TS3.101/TS3.21 precipitation totals \citep{harris_cru_2014}.
The data products show some differences (Figures S3-S4, which compare data products over currently cultivated areas for each crop). 
For example, for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{maize}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{maize-growing areas}\DIFaddend , ERA-Interim daily precipitation is biased high from that in AgMERRA by 7\% (< 1 sigma), while mean daily precipitation in WFDEI is only 3\% higher. 
Precipitation differences are largest in wheat areas, where ERA-Interim is substantially wetter (+\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{60mm }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{60 mm }\DIFaddend year$^{-1}$ or 10\%). 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Temperatures for maize are very similar between data products}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Temperature differences are largest for rice}\DIFaddend , with ERA-Interim \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{0.45}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1}\DIFaddend $^\circ$C cooler \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and WFDEI 0.1$^\circ$C warmer. 
Differences are largest for rice, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{than AgMERRA, and smaller for other crops, e.g.\ maize }\DIFaddend with ERA-Interim \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{1}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{0.45}\DIFaddend $^\circ$C cooler \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and WFDEI 0.1$^\circ$C warmer}\DIFaddend . 
These differences are relatively small compared to the perturbations tested in the protocol.

Planting dates and growing season lengths are standardized across models, following the procedure described in \citet{Elliott2015} for the \textit{fullharm} setting. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In contrast to GGCMI Phase I \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Elliott2015}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
, we here assume }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(The exception is that Phase 2, unlike Phase 1, uses }\DIFaddend identical growing seasons for rainfed and irrigated \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{scenarios}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{cases}\DIFaddend , to allow for direct \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{comparability }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{comparison }\DIFaddend of simulations along the W dimension\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, in which irrigation (W$_{\infty}$) is one element.
(See Table \ref{table:inputs}.) 
While }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.) %DIF >  (See Table \ref{table:inputs}.) 
This harmonization is important because the parametrization of growing seasons can have strong effects on simulated yields \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{muller_global_2017, Jag2018}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
.
In all the GGCMI Phase 2 crop models, }\DIFaddend sowing dates are prescribed directly\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and held fixed in models, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, but }\DIFaddend the length of the growing season is a product of crop phenology, which \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in turn is mostly driven }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is driven mostly }\DIFaddend by phenological parameters and temperature. 
Modelers \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{were therefore }\DIFaddend asked to adjust \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{their }\DIFaddend phenological parameters so that \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the average }\DIFaddend growing season length of the baseline scenario (C=360, T=0, W=0) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{on average matches }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{matched }\DIFaddend the harmonization target. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Given that temperature varies between years, individual years can vary from the harmonization target. Growing seasons are harmonized across models but are }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(The one exception to this harmonization protocol involves CARAIB, whose team kept their own growing season specifications rather than tuning to standard lengths.)
Two aspects of the procedure should be noted. First, the target growing seasons used in GGCMI Phase 2 are }\DIFaddend crop- and location-specific.
For example, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{at present }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{present-day }\DIFaddend maize is sown in March in Spain, in July in Indonesia, and in December in Namibia \citep{Portmann2010}.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The one exception to the harmonization protocol described above involves CARAIB, which for technical reasons kept their own growing season specifications rather than tuning to standard lengths}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Second, because temperature varies between years in the 30-year baseline climatology, realized growing season length will still vary in individual years even after harmonization}\DIFaddend . 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Because harvest dates are a function of climate parameters , simulations with the harmonized phenological parameters described above generally result in shorter }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The dependence of harvest dates on climate parameters means that growing seasons will alter under climate change in a model with phenological parameters tuned to match target }\DIFaddend growing seasons in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{future warmer scenarios}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the baseline climate. In general, warmer future scenarios produce shorter growing seasons}\DIFaddend .
We denote \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{these simulations }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{simulations that allow these future changes }\DIFaddend as ``A0'' experiments, where 0 denotes ``no adaptation''. 
 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{To account for potential adaptation in crop cultivars, the GGCMI Phase II }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The GGCMI Phase 2 }\DIFaddend protocol includes a second set of experiments, ``A1'', that assume that \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{future }\DIFaddend cultivars are modified to adjust to changes along the T dimension in the CTWN experiment.  %DIF > To account for potential adaptation in crop cultivars,
For these simulations, modelers adjust \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{parameters }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{phenological parameters for each temperature scenario }\DIFaddend to hold growing season length approximately constant\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{across the different warming scenarios}\DIFdelend . 
(CARAIB simulations follow the same principle, fixing growing season length at their baseline levels.) 
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{That is, the A1 simulations require running a model with seven different choices of cultivar parameters, one per warming level. Parameter settings for T=0 are identical in both A0 and A1. 
}\DIFaddend The A1 simulations roughly capture the case in which adaptive crop cultivar choice ensures that crops reach maturity at roughly the same time as in the current temperature regime. 
This assumption is simplistic, and does not reflect realistic opportunities and limitations to adaptation \citep{vadez2012adaptation,challinor2018improving}, but provides some insight into how crop modifications could alter projected impacts on yields and is sufficiently easy to implement in a large model intercomparison project as GGCMI.

Growing seasons for maize, rice, and soybean are taken from the SAGE (Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment, University of Wisconsin) crop calendar \citep{Sacks2010}, gap-filled with the MIRCA2000 crop calendar \citep{Portmann2010} and, if no SAGE or MIRCA2000 data are available, with simulated LPJmL growing seasons \citep{waha2012climate} and are identical to those used in GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{I }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1 }\DIFaddend \citep{Elliott2015}.
In GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2}\DIFaddend , we separately treat spring and winter wheat and so must define different growing seasons for each.
As for the other crops, we use the SAGE crop calendar, which separately specifies spring and winter wheat, as the primary source for 69\% of grid cells. 
In the remaining areas where no SAGE information is available, we turn to, in order of preference, the MIRCA2000 crop calendar \citep{Portmann2010} and to simulated LPJmL growing seasons \citep{waha2012climate}.  
These datasets each provide several options for wheat growing season for each grid cell, but do not label them as spring or winter wheat. 
We assign a growing season to each wheat type for each location based on its baseline climate conditions. 
A growing season is assigned to winter wheat if all of the following hold, and to spring wheat otherwise:

\begin{itemize}
  \item{the monthly mean temperature is below freezing point (<0$^\circ$C) at most for 5 months per year (i.e. winter is not too long)}
  \item{the coldest 3 months of a year are below 10$^\circ$C (i.e.\ there is a winter)}
  \item{the season start date fits the criteria that:}
  \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \item[]{\begin{itemize}  
%DIFDELCMD <       \item{if in the N.\ hemisphere, it is after the warmest \textit{or} before the coldest month of the year (as winter is around the end/beginning of the calendar year)}
%DIFDELCMD <       \item{if in the S.\ hemisphere, it is after the warmest \textit{and} before the coldest month of the year (as winter is in the middle of the calendar year)}
%DIFDELCMD <       \end{itemize}}
%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \item[]{
    \begin{itemize}  
      \item{if in the N.\ hemisphere, it is after the warmest \textit{or} before the coldest month of the year (as winter is around the end/beginning of the calendar year)}
      \item{if in the S.\ hemisphere, it is after the warmest \textit{and} before the coldest month of the year (as winter is in the middle of the calendar year)}
      \end{itemize}
      }
\DIFaddend \end{itemize}

Nitrogen (N) application is standardized in timing across models. 
N fertilizer is applied in two doses, as is often the norm in actual practice, to reduce losses to the environment. 
In the GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 }\DIFaddend protocol, half of the total fertilizer input is applied at sowing and the other half on day 40 after sowing, for all crops except for winter wheat. 
For winter wheat, in practice the application date for the second N fertilizer application varies according to local temperature, because the length of winter dormancy can vary strongly. 
In the GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 }\DIFaddend protocol, the second fertilization date for winter wheat must lie at least 40 days after planting and -- if not contradicting the distance to planting -- no later than 50 days before maturity.
If those limits permit, the second fertilization is set to the middle day of the first month after sowing that has average temperatures above 8$^\circ$C.

All stresses in models are disabled other than those related to nitrogen, temperature, and water. 
For example, model responses to alkalinity, salinity, and non-nitrogen nutrients are all disabled. 
No other external N inputs are permitted -- that is, there is no atmospheric deposition of nitrogen --  but some models allow additional release of plant-available nitrogen through mineralization in soils. 
In LPJmL, LPJ-GUESS and APSIM, soil mineralization is a part of model treatments of soil organic matter and cannot be disabled.
Some additional differences in model structure mean that several key factors are not standardized across the experiment. 
For example, carry-over effects across growing years including residue management and soil moisture are treated differently across models.

\subsection{Output data products}

All output data is supplied as netCDF version 4 files, each containing values for one variable in a 30-year timeseries associated with a single scenario, for all grid cells. File names follow the naming conventions of GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{I }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1 }\DIFaddend \citep{Elliott2015}, which themselves are derived from those of ISIMIP \citep{frieler2017assessing}. 
File names are specified as 

\scalebox{0.9}{
$[model]\_[climate]\_hist\_fullharm\_[variable]\_[crop]\_global\_annual\_[start-year]\_[end-year]\_[C]\_[T]\_[W]\_[N]\_[A].nc4$
}

\noindent Here $[model]$ is the crop model name; $[climate]$ is the original climate input dataset (typically AgMERRA); $[variable]$ is the output variable (of those in Table \ref{table:outputs}); $[crop]$ is the crop abbreviation (``mai'' for maize, ``ric'' for rice, ``soy'' for soybean, ``swh'' for spring wheat, and ``wwh'' for winter wheat); and $[start-year]$ and $[end-year]$ specify the first and last years recorded on file.
$[C]$, $[T]$, $[W]$, $[N]$ and $[A]$ indicate the CTWN-A settings, each represented with the respective uppercase letter and the number indicating the level (e.g. ``C360\_T0\_W0\_N200'' see Table \ref{table:inputs}). 
Except for the CTWN-A letters, the entire file name needs to be in small caps. 
All filenames include the identifiers $global$ and $annual$ to distinguish them as global, annual model output, following the updated ISIMIP file naming convention \citep{frieler2017assessing}.

Output data is provided on a regular geographic grid, identical for all models. 
Grid cell centers span latitudes -89.75 to 89.75$^{\circ}$ and longitudes from -179.75 to 179.75$^{\circ}$. 
Missing values where no crop growth has been simulated are distinguished from crop failures: a crop failure is reported as zero yield but non-simulated areas (including ocean grid cells) have yields reported as ``missing values'' (defined as 1.e+20 in the netCDF files). 
Following NetCDF standards, latitude, longitude and time are included as separate variables in ascending order, with
units ``degrees north'', ``degrees east'', and ``growing seasons since 1980-01-01 00:00:00''. 

Following GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{I }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1 }\DIFaddend standards, the first entry in each file describes the first complete cropping cycle simulated from the given climate input timeseries. 
In the AgMERRA timeseries used for GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2}\DIFaddend , the first year provided is 1980 but the date of the first entry can vary by crop and location. 
In the northern hemisphere, for summer crops like maize (sown in spring 1980 and harvested in fall 1980), the first harvest record would be of 1980, but for winter wheat (sown in fall 1980 and harvested in spring 1981) the first harvest record would be of 1981. Output files report the sequence of growing periods rather than calendar years. 
While there is generally one sowing event per calendar year (since simulations with harmonized growing seasons do not permit double-cropping), in some cases harvest events may skip or repeat within a calendar year.
For example, because soybeans in North Carolina are typically harvested well into December, some calendar years may include no harvest (if it is not completed until after Dec. 31) or two harvests (one in January and one 11 months later in the following December). 

\section{Models contributing}
\label{S:3}
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFadd{The 12 models participating in GGCMI Phase 2 are listed in Table \ref{table:models}. 
Models differ substantially in structure and parameterization and can be separated into two broad categories: site-based (field-scale) models, and global ecosystem models.
The 6 site-based models are APSIM, pDSSAT, and the EPIC family of models; the 6 ecosystem models are LPJmL, LPJ-GUESS, PROMET, CARAIB, ORCHIDEE, and JULES.
Models employ a variety of approaches for the core modules such as primary production or evapotranspiration.
For primary production, site-based models employ light use efficiency approaches and ecosystem models use photosynthesis approaches.
For evapotranspiration, most models use Priestley-Taylor, Penman-Monteith or Hargreaves schemes, but JULES and PROMET utilize a land surface model approach instead. 
Note that models that share a common genealogy may still use different schemes for evapotranspiration:
for example, EPIC-TAMU uses Penman-Monteith and EPIC-IIASA uses Hargreaves.

Not all modeling groups provided simulations for the full protocol described above. 
Given the substantial computational requirements, different participation tiers were specified to allow submission of smaller sub-sets of the full protocol. 
These subsets were designed as alternate samples across the 4 dimensions of the CTWN space,with \textit{full} (12) and \textit{low} (4) options for the C $\cdot$ N variables, and \textit{full} (63), \textit{reduced} (31), and \textit{minimum} (9) options for T $\cdot$ W variables (described below). 
All participating modeling groups provided identical coverage of the CTWN parameter space for different crops, but most differed in CTWN coverage of A0 and A1 scenarios. Since the adaptation dimension was defined as a secondary priority for GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2}\DIFaddend , some models provided a more limited set of A1 scenarios. Of these, EPIC-IIASA, JULES, and ORCHIDEE-crop provided no A1 scenarios.

The different participation levels are defined by combining the CxN sets with the TxW sets:
\begin{itemize}
  \item{\textbf{full}: all 756 A0 simulations (all 12 CxN * all 63 TxW)}
  \item{\textbf{high}: 362 simulations (all 12 CxN combinations  $\cdot$ \textit{reduced} TxW set of 31 combinations)}
  \item{\textbf{mid}: 124 simulations (\textit{low} 4 CxN combinations $\cdot$ \textit{reduced} TxW set of 31 combinations)}
  \item{\textbf{low}: 36 simulations (\textit{low} 4 CxN combinations $\cdot$ \textit{minimum} TxW set of 9 combinations)}
\end{itemize}

\noindent Of the 12 models submitting data, 6 followed the \textit{full} protocol; these are marked with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{italic text in }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{bold text in the last column of }\DIFaddend Table \ref{table:models}. 
However, note that two of these models (CARAIB and JULES) cannot represent nitrogen effects explicitly and so do not sample over the nitrogen dimension. 
Two models followed \textit{high} with minor modifications (GEPIC adding an additional T level and PROMET omitting the intermediate N level). 
One model (PEPIC) followed \textit{mid} but included an additional C level. 
Three models approximately followed \textit{low} with APSIM-UGOE and EPIC-IIASA providing some additional TxW levels and ORCHIDEE-crop omitting some TxW combinations.  

The combinations of perturbation values in the CxN and TxW parameter spaces used in the various participation levels are chosen to provide maximum coverage over plausible future values. For the CxN space, we specify:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{full} as 12 pairs, with 4 C values (360, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{510, }\DIFaddend 660, 810 ppm) and 3 N (10, 60, 200 kg ha$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$)
  \item \textit{low} as only 4 pairs: C360\_N10, C360\_N200, C660\_N60, C810\_N200
\end{itemize}

For the TxW space we specify:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{full} as all 7 T levels and 9W levels.
  \item \textit{reduced} as 31 alternating combinations, with different Ws for even Ts than for odd Ts. For even Ts (i.e.\ T0,T2,T4,T6), we use W = -50,-20,0,+30 = 4$\cdot$4 = 16 pairs. For odd Ts (i.e.\ T-1,T1,T3) , we use W = -30, -10, +10, +30, inf = 3$\cdot$5 = 15 pairs.
  \item \textit{minimum} as 9 combinations: T-1W-10, T0W10, T1W-30, T2W-50, T2W20, T3W30, T4W0, T4Winf, T6W-20

\section{Results}
\label{S:4}

To illustrate the properties of the GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 }\DIFaddend model simulations, we provide an evaluation of model performance by comparing model and historical yields, and show example results that demonstrate the spread of model responses to climate and management inputs.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{All models participating in GGCMI Phase 2 have be evaluated against histoircal yields and site specific experimental data.
Most models (9 of 12, all but  CARAIB, JULES, and PROMET) have been evaluated in their global setup in the GGCMI Phase 1 evaluation exercise \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

\citep[e.g.][]{von_Bloh_implementing_2018}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
.
}\DIFaddend Evaluating the performance of crop models in the GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 }\DIFaddend archive is complicated by the artificial nature of the protocol: the settings in the CTWN-A experiment design do not reflect actual conditions in the real world. 
The protocol includes one scenario of near-historical climate inputs (T$_0$, W$_0$, C$_{360}$), but the prescribed uniform nitrogen application levels do not reflect real-world fertilizer practices. Models also omit detailed calibrations to reflect the performance of historical cultivars. 

We provide a partial evaluation of the models\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{’ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{' }\DIFaddend skill in reproducing crop yield characteristics using the methodology of \citet{muller_global_2017}, developed for GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{I.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1.
}\DIFaddend \citet{muller_global_2017} evaluate how well model crop yield responses in a historical run capture real-world yield variations driven by year-to-year temperature and precipitation variations. 
Following this approach, we compare yields in the GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 }\DIFaddend baseline simulations with detrended historical yields from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations \citep{FAOSTAT} by calculating the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient over 26 years of yield.
The procedure is sensitive to the detrending method and the area mask used to aggregate yields; we use a 5-year running mean removal and the MIRCA2000 cultivation area mask for aggregation. 
In some cases the model timeseries are shifted by one year to account for discrepancies in FAO or model year reporting. 
Because the GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 }\DIFaddend protocol imposes fixed, uniform nitrogen application levels that are not realistic for individual countries, we evaluate control runs for each model at multiple N levels whenever possible. 
Nine of the GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 }\DIFaddend models (Table 3) provide historical runs for all three nitrogen levels (10, 60, and. 200 kg ha$^-1$ yr$^-1$).

As expected due to the unrealistic features described above, correlation coefficients for the GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 }\DIFaddend simulations are slightly lower than those found in the Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{I }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1 }\DIFaddend evaluation, but models show reasonable fidelity at capturing year-over-year variation (Figure \ref{fig:simulation_val}). 
For example, global correlation coefficients \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{for maize in Phase I and Phase II }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in Phase 1 and Phase 2, respectively, }\DIFaddend are 0.89 and 0.74 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, respectively; for wheat }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for maize, }\DIFaddend 0.67 and 0.64 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, and for soybeans }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for wheat, and }\DIFaddend 0.64 and 0.59 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.
(Compare to \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{muller_global_2017} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for soybeans.
(Phase 1 values are from }\DIFaddend Figures 1--4 and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{6.}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{6 in \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{muller_global_2017}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
.}\DIFaddend )  
Differences in fidelity between regions and crops exceed differences between models: that is, Figure \ref{fig:simulation_val}\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(c)--\ref{fig:simulation_val}(f) }\DIFaddend shows more color similarity in horizontal than vertical bars. 
For example, maize in the United States is consistently well-simulated while maize in Indonesia is problematic (mean Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.68 and 0.18, respectively). 
Note that in this methodology, simulations of crops with low year-to-year variability such as irrigated rice and wheat will tend to score more poorly than those with higher variability.
In some cases, especially in the developing world, low correlation coefficients may point to reporting problems in the FAO statistics and to real-world variability caused by variations in management rather than weather \citep{Ray2012, muller_global_2017}. 
No single model consistently exhibits greater fidelity than others. 
Instead, each model shows near best-in-class performance for at least one location-crop combination. 
For example, pDSSAT is the best model for maize in the US, LPJmL and GEPIC are best in Germany, PROMET is best in Argentina, and PEPIC and LPJ-GUESS are best in France.

Crop models in the GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 }\DIFaddend ensemble show broadly consistent responses to climate and management perturbations in most regions, with a strong negative impact of increased temperature in all but the coldest regions. 
Mapping the distribution of baseline yields and yield changes shows the geographic dependencies that underlie these results. 
Absolute yield potentials show strong spatial variation, with much of the Earth's surface area unsuitable for any of these crops (Figure \ref{fig:maizesoybaseline}, left).
Crop yield changes under climate perturbations also show distinct geographic patterns (Figure \ref{fig:maizesoybaseline}, right, which shows fractional yield differences between the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{baseline and }\DIFaddend T+4 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{scenario and the baseline scenario with historical climatology}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{A0 scenarios}\DIFaddend ).
In general, models agree most on yield response in regions where yield potentials are currently high and therefore where crops are currently grown. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Models }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In A0 simulations, models }\DIFaddend show robust decreases in yields at low latitudes, and highly uncertain ensemble mean increases at most high latitudes.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Models }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Low latitude yield reductions are due in part to shortenting of the growing season under warming and in part to the direct effects of higher temperature.
In A1 simulations, where growing seasons length does not change, temperature-related reductions in yield are more muted (see Supplemental Figure S14).
In both A0 and A1 simulations, models }\DIFaddend show some increases in high mountain regions that are currently cold-limited.

Projections of strong yield growth at higher latitudes should be treated with caution, since the effects evident in Figure \ref{fig:maizesoybaseline} are due in part to inaccuracies in model representations of present-day crop yields. 
For example, at latitudes north of 45$^\circ$, the GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 }\DIFaddend models collectively suggest strong (but uncertain) growth in soybean yields under warmer conditions (Figure \ref{fig:maizesoybaseline}, g). 
However, model differences are greater in the baseline than future simulations, and greatest in currently-cultivated areas (Figure \ref{fig:highlat}). 
Both the mean projected growth and the inter-model spread are driven by three models that show almost zero present-day potential soybean yields across the entire high-latitude region, even in locations where soybeans are currently grown (Figure \ref{fig:highlat}, left).
PROMET, for example, involves a stronger response to cold than other models (e.g.\ LPJmL) with frost below -8 $^\circ$C irreversibly killing non-winter crops and prolonged periods of below-optimum temperatures also leading to complete crop failure. 
Over the high-latitude regions simulated by both models, 52\% of grid cells in PROMET report 0 yield in the present climate vs.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ 
}\DIFaddend 11\% of cells in the T+4 scenario, leading to a strong yield gain in warmer future climates. 
In LPJmL outputs, the same high-latitude area is deemed suitable for cultivation even in baseline climate, with crop failure rates of 4\% and 5\% in present and T+4 cases, so that projected yield changes are modest (Figure \ref{fig:highlat}).
These spurious low baseline yields result in very large fractional changes in the T+4 warming scenario, when all models agree that conditions become favorable for soybeans. 
Those models that most accurately reproduce present-day high-latitude soybean yields of 1-2 ton ha$^{-1}$ \citep{Ray2012} in fact show a slight decrease in yield under a warming scenario (Figure \ref{fig:highlat}, left). 
Apparent future yield increases in the multi-model mean are driven by the least realistic simulations.

The GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 }\DIFaddend exercise offers the opportunity to examine and characterize not just crop response to a single temperature change but nonlinearities in responses and interactions between factors. 
We illustrate a few of these relationships in Figures \ref{fig:maizerice}-\ref{fig:soywheat} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, choosing }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{using A0 simulations to capture maximum climate effects.
We choose }\DIFaddend crops and factors whose effects are reasonably well understood\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, and show that these are reproduced in models}\DIFaddend . 
It is expected, for instance, that increases in precipitation should buffer the effects of warmer temperatures and that CO$_2$ increases should reduce damage to crops in scenarios where water is limited. 
Models generally confirm expected behavior but also provide insight into unforeseen interactions. 
To show geographic effects, we divide model responses in Figures \ref{fig:maizerice}-\ref{fig:soywheat} by the primary K\"{o}ppen-Geiger climate regions \citep{rubel2010}, showing the yield changes across all simulated grid cells in each region. 
In each panel we examine relationships between two factors, showing yield response against one for several scenarios of the other, in box plots that show the inter-model spread. 
The responses highlighted here are qualitatively similar across all crops included in this study (Supplemental Figures \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{S5 - S8}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S5--S9 for all simulated area and S10--S13 for cultivated area only}\DIFaddend ). 

For all crops, warming scenarios with precipitation held constant produce yield decreases in most regions. 
These impacts are robust for even moderate climate perturbations. 
For rainfed maize, even a 1$^\circ$C temperature increase with other factors held constant produces a median regional decline in potential yield that exceeds the variance across models, in all but the ``cold-continental'' regions (Figure \ref{fig:maizerice}a). 
The remaining areas (``warm temperate'', ``equatorial'', and ``arid'') account for nearly three-quarters of global maize production. 
In the high-latitude ``cold-continental'' region, potential yield changes are positive but highly uncertain, for the reasons discussed previously; uncertainties are larger even for maize than for soybeans. 
(Compare Figures \ref{fig:maizerice}a and \ref{fig:maizerice}b.) 
Temperature effects are somewhat nonlinear, with the largest impacts for maize in the warm ``tropical'' region \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. 
(For }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(for }\DIFaddend soybeans, temperature effects are more complex; see Supplemental Figure S5\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{). 
}\DIFaddend Precipitation effects on rainfed crops are more strongly nonlinear. 
The curvature of the precipitation response can be seen by eye in Figure \ref{fig:maizerice}b: soybean yields are strongly negatively impacted by reduced rainfall, peak under increased precipitation of 20\%, and actually decline at higher precipitation levels. 

As expected, precipitation and temperature effects interact, with increases in precipitation buffering yield responses to temperature. 
Increased rainfall mitigates the negative impacts of warmer temperatures caused by increased evapotranspiration \citep[e.g.][]{Allen1998}. 
For maize, the effect is relatively modest outside the ``arid'' regions (Figure \ref{fig:maizerice}a). 
Globally, a 4$^\circ$C temperature rise with no change in precipitation results in median loss of $\sim$13\% of rainfed maize, with all models showing a negative response.
With a 20\% increase in precipitation, the median yield loss is $\sim$8\%. 
For soybeans, the equivalent values are $\sim$11\% and 1\%, respectively. 
Decreased rainfall, on the other hand, amplifies yield losses and also increases inter-model variance. 
That is, models agree that the response to decreased water availability is negative in sign but disagree on its magnitude. 
Outside of arid regions, the interaction effect itself shows little nonlinearity (i.e. response slopes in Figures \ref{fig:maizerice}a and \ref{fig:maizerice}b are roughly parallel). 
As expected, irrigated crops are more resilient to temperature increases in all regions, especially so where water is already limiting (other than winter wheat, Supplemental Figure S9).

Increased CO$_2$ boosts yields overall through the well-known CO$_2$ fertilization effect (Figure \ref{fig:soywheat}). 
The effect is strongest for the C3 crops (wheat, soybeans, and rice), while maize, a C4 grass, has a comparatively muted response. 
We show irrigated rice and rainfed soy in Figure \ref{fig:soywheat} as representative C3 crops.  
The effect of CO$_2$ on yields is nonlinear, as expected, with significant benefit from small increases but with effects plateauing at higher concentrations (Figure \ref{fig:soywheat}). 
CO$_2$ and temperature effects show minimal interaction. 
This effect is seen in Figure \ref{fig:soywheat}a, which shows nearly parallel response slopes at different CO$_2$ levels. 
That is, CO$_2$ fertilization does little to change the nature of the temperature response. 
On the other hand, CO$_2$ and precipitation effects interact strongly, as expected since higher CO$_2$ levels allow reduced stomatal conductance and evapotranspiration losses, mitigating the effect of reduced rainfall \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[e.g.][]{McGrath2013}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . 
This interaction is seen in Figure \ref{fig:soywheat}b as smaller yield losses from reduced rainfall when CO$_2$ levels are higher. 
For example, for soy, raising CO$_2$ to 510 ppm actually outweighs the multi-model median damages caused by a 20\% precipitation reduction in all climate regions. 
All crops show similar behavior, but note that model uncertainties for wheat are substantially higher than those for other crops. 
(Compare Figure \ref{fig:soywheat}a for soy and Supplemental Figure S7 for wheat).

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We show some additional cases in Supplemental Material. As noted previously, the A1 adaptation simulations involve significatly moderated temperature impacts relative to the A0 simulastions shown here (Supplemental Figure S14).  
Supplemental Figures S15 and S16 show the response in the nitrogen dimension and an irrigation water demand response example.

\DIFaddend \section{Discussion and Conclusions} 
\label{S:5}
The GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 }\DIFaddend experiment provides a database designed to allow detailed study of crop yields in process-based models under climate change. 
While previous crop model intercomparison projects in the climate change context have focused on simulations along realistic projected climate scenarios \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[e.g][]{Rosenzweig2014}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[e.g.][]{Rosenzweig2014}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend , the use of systematic input parameter variations in GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II (}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2, }\DIFaddend with up to 756 scenarios\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend allows not only comparing yield sensitivities to changing climate and management inputs but also evaluating the complex interactions between important driving factors: CO$_2$, temperature, water supply, and applied \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Nitrogen}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{nitrogen}\DIFaddend . 
The global extent of the experiment also allows identifying geographic shifts in high potential yield locations. 
With 12 participating models and 31 simulation years per scenario\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend the complete database constitutes over 150,000 years of gridded global yield simulation output for each crop.

Preliminary results shown here highlight some of the insights facilitated by the simulation exercise and lend confidence in the models. 
In validation tests of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{simulations of the historical scenario}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{historical simulations}\DIFaddend , year-over-year correlations in modeled and actual country-level yields are similar to those of GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{I. In simulations on }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1. 
In simulations of }\DIFaddend scenarios with perturbed climate and management factors, models \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{generally }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{broadly }\DIFaddend agree on changes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{driven }\DIFdelend outside the high latitudes, with \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the magnitude of }\DIFaddend changes at nearly all perturbation levels exceeding the inter-model spread. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(}\DIFdelend At high latitudes, differences \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are often driven by differences in model treatment of crop response to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{between models may result from differences in their assumed yields in }\DIFaddend current cold conditions. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{) 
}\DIFdelend In simulations with multiple perturbations, interactions between major yield drivers (\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{e.g.\ }\DIFaddend temperature and precipitation in Figure \ref{fig:maizerice}, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{or }\DIFaddend precipitation and CO$_2$ in Figure \ref{fig:soywheat}) generally follow expectations and produce physically reasonable responses in crop yields.

Users should however be aware of some limitations of the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GGCMI Phase 2 }\DIFaddend experiment that affect its potential applications. 
First, absolute \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{model }\DIFdelend yield values in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{historical scenario}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{baseline scenario, driven by 1981--2010 historical climate, }\DIFaddend will generally not match observed yields \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{over this time period}\DIFaddend . 
In order to match current yields, process-based models must \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{generally }\DIFdelend be re-tuned to account for the constant evolution of crop cultivar genetics and management practice \citep[e.g.][]{JONES2017b}. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The historical scenario also includes no trend in CO$_2$, and scenarios assume unrealistic globally uniform nitrogen application levels \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Elliott2015}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. 
GGCMI Phase II }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GGCMI Phase 2 }\DIFaddend is intended as a study of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{model-projected changes under broad climate change, which may not be as sensitive }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{model responses to changes in climatic conditions, which are assumed insensitivee }\DIFaddend to the adjustments needed to reproduce present-day yields. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Note however that the models used in this exercise cannot simulate some potential climate-related yield changes: those due to factors such as pests, diseases, and weeds}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The baseline scenario also includes no trend in CO$_2$, and no individual case involves realistic country-specific nitrogen application levels \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Elliott2015}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend .


The second major caveat is that no individual GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 }\DIFaddend simulation is itself a realistic future yield projection. 
The uniform applied offsets in temperature and precipitation sample over potential changes, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{but projections of climate change involve }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and do not individually capture the }\DIFaddend spatially heterogeneous warming and precipitation changes \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{expected in realistic climate projections}\DIFaddend . 
GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 }\DIFaddend simulation results can be used for impacts projection, but only with the construction of an emulator of crop yield response to climatological changes, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that is then driven by a realistic climate projection.
However, note that the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{which can then by driven by arbitrary climate scenarios.
Such emulators are shown to accurately reproduce crop model output under realistic climate projections, even though the GGCMI Phase 2 }\DIFaddend experiment
does not sample over potential changes in the higher-order moments in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the distributions in }\DIFdelend temperature and precipitation \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{distributions \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Franke2020}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
.
Note that some factors that may affect future climate-driven yield impacts cannot be captured by the GGCMI Phase 2 models in any usage, since models do not include representations of pests, diseases, and weeds. Off-line crop model simulations (i.e. with prescribed rather than dynamically simulated atmospheric conditions) can also not capture any feedbacks on the climate from land use, such as irrigation impacts on humidity \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[e.g.][]{Decker2017}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
.
}\DIFaddend 

%DIF >  SAVE 
%DIF > As such it also remains challenging to evaluate model performance as the actual growing conditions have to be interpolated between the uniform input levels used in the GGCMI Phase 2 setup. 
%DIF > XXX -separate paragraph?? As most simulation studies on climate change impacts on crop yields, the simulations here are driven by external weather data, i.e. feedbacks from plant growth (e.g. albedo, evapotranspiration) and management (e.g. irrigation) on the atmosphere are not included here. 
%DIF > While we acknowledge that these mechanisms exist , these feedbacks need to be explored in more specialized analyzes, as they require an Earth-system model analysis framework, which is in conflict with the design of systematic offsets in climatic drivers.
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend We expect that the GGCMI Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{II }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 }\DIFaddend simulations will yield multiple insights in future studies. 
Potential applications include, as mentioned, the construction of emulators and yield response \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{surface, as well as studies of issues such as }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{surfaces that can be used for both model diagnosis and impacts assessment. Specific studies could include analyzing the drivers of temperature-related yield losses (which may be due to both direct thermal effects or to shortening growing seasons); }\DIFaddend the benefits of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{adaptation, interactions between the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{adaption; interactions between CO$_2$ and water or other }\DIFaddend CTWN factors affecting yield\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{; }\DIFaddend changes in nitrogen use efficiency\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{; }\DIFaddend geographic shifts in regional production\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, investigation of core sensitivities to CTWN/A by region and farm system, identification of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{; regional differences in yield sensitivities to CTWN-A factors. Emulators based on the dataset can be used to identify }\DIFaddend hotspots of crop system vulnerability, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and to conduct }\DIFaddend rapid assessment of new climate projections\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, and many others}\DIFdelend .  In general, the development of multi-model ensembles involving systematic \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{parameters }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{parameter }\DIFaddend sweeps has large promise both for increasing understanding of potential future crop responses and for improving process-based crop models.

We expect that the GGCMI Phase 2 simulations will yield multiple 
insights in future studies.
Potential applications include, as mentioned, the construction of 
emulators and yield response surfaces that can be used for both model 
diagnosis and impacts assessment. Specific studies could include 
analyzing the drivers of temperature-related yield losses (which may be 
due to both direct thermal effects or to shortening growing seasons); 
the benefits of adaption; interactions between CO$_2$ and water or other 
CTWN factors affecting yield; changes in nitrogen use efficiency; 
geographic shifts in regional production; regional differences in yield 
sensitivities to CTWN-A factors. Emulators based on the dataset can be 
used to identify hotspots of crop system vulnerability, and to conduct 
rapid assessment of new climate projections.  In general, the 
development of multi-model ensembles involving systematic parameter 
sweeps has large promise both for increasing understanding of potential 
future crop responses and for improving process-based crop models.
