\begin{abstract}
Concerns about food security under climate change have motivated efforts to better understand the future changes in yields by using detailed process-based models in agronomic sciences.
Process-based models differ on many details affecting yields and considerable uncertainty remains in future yield projections.
Phase II of the Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison (GGCMI), an activity of the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP), consists of a large simulation set with perturbations in atmospheric CO$_2$ concentrations, temperature, precipitation, and applied nitrogen inputs and constitutes a data-rich basis of projected yield changes across twelve models and five crops (maize, soy, rice, spring wheat, and winter wheat) using global gridded simulations.
In this paper we present the simulation output database from Phase II of the GGCMI effort, a targeted experiment aimed at understanding the sensitivity to and interaction between multiple climate variables (as well as management) on yields, and illustrate some initial summary results from the model intercomparison project.
We also present the construction of a simple ``emulator’’ or statistical representation of the simulated 30-year mean climatological output in each location for each crop and model.
The emulator captures the response of the process-based models in a lightweight, computationally tractable form that facilitates model comparison as well as potential applications in subsequent modeling efforts such as integrated assessment. 

%Results of these models are often used to inform subsequent model-based analyses in agricultural economics and integrated assessment, but the computational requirements of process-based models sometimes hamper the ability to utilize these models in existing impact assessment frameworks at high resolutions globally. 
%Models robustly produce yield responses that are nonlinear and sensitive to interactions across the input variables. 
%Results illustrate the utility of model emulation for climate impacts studies.
%Fundamental feedbacks between economic decision making and crop performance (e.g.\ management for intensification) is often ignored, as better integration of the different model types is hampered by the computational requirements of detailed deterministic process-based crop models and optimization-based economic modeling frameworks. 
% STEFAN: Why? Differences among models is not an aim, is an outcome from the fact that much is still unknown regarding first principles.
%Results show considerable spatial heterogeneity in sensitivity to input variables, confirming the need for a global study, as well as differences across models.
% STEFAN: Have other studies confirmed that? Otherwise it's not an aim in itself to have that as an outcpme of this study.

\section{Introduction}
\label{S:1}

Projecting crop yield response to a changing climate is of great importance, especially as the global food production system will face pressure from increased demand over the next century. Climate-related reductions in supply could therefore have severe socioeconomic consequences. Multiple studies with different crop or climate models predict sharp reduction in yields on currently cultivated cropland under {business-as-usual} climate scenarios, although their yield projections show considerable spread \citep[e.g.][and references therein]{porter2014, Rosenzweig2014, Schauberger2017}. Model differences are unsurprising because crop responses in models can be complex, with crop growth a function of complex interactions between climate inputs and management practices. 

Computational Models have been used to project crop yields since the 1950's, beginning with statistical models \citep{Heady57, Heady61} that attempt to capture the relationship between input factors and resultant yields. These statistical models were typically developed on a small scale for locations with extensive histories of yield data. The emergence of computers allowed development of numerical models that simulate the process of photosynthesis and the biology and phenology of individual crops (first proposed by \citet{wit58, Duncan67} and attempted by \citet{Duncan72}). For a history of crop model development see the appendix of \citet{Rosenzweig2014}. A half-century of improvement in both models and computing resources means that researchers can now run crop simulation models for many years at high spatial resolution on the global scale. 

Both types of models continue to be used, and comparative studies have concluded that when done carefully, both approaches can provide similar yield estimates \citep[e.g.][]{Lobell2010, Moore2017, Roberts2017, zhao2017}. Models tend to agree broadly in major response patterns, including a reasonable representation of the spatial pattern in historical yields of major crops \citep[e.g.][]{Elliott2015, muller_global_2017} and projections of decreases in yield under future climate scenarios.

Process models do continue to struggle with some important details, including reproducing historical year-to-year variability \citep[e.g.][]{muller_global_2017}, reproducing historical yields when driven by reanalysis weather \citep[e.g.][]{Glotter14}, and low sensitivity to extreme events \citep[e.g.][]{Glotter15}. These issues are driven in part by the diversity of new cultivars and genetic variants, which outstrips the ability of academic modeling groups to capture them \citep[e.g.][]{JONES2017b}. Models do not simulate many additional factors affecting production, including pests/diseases/weeds. For these reasons, individual studies must generally re-calibrate models to ensure that short-term predictions reflect current cultivar mixes, and long-term projections retain considerable uncertainty \citep{WOLF2002217, JAGTAP200273, Iizumi2010, ANGULO201332, Asseng2013, Asseng2015}. Inter-model discrepancies can also be high in areas not yet cultivated \citep[e.g.][]{Challinor2014, WHITE2011357}. Finally, process-based models present additional difficulties for high-resolution global studies because of their complexity and computational requirements. For economic impacts assessments, it is often impossible to integrate a set of process-based crop models directly into an integrated assessment model to estimate the potential cost of climate change to the agricultural sector.

Nevertheless, process-based models are necessary for understanding the global future yield impacts of climate change for many reasons. First, cultivation may shift to new areas, where no yield data are currently available and therefore statistical models cannot apply. Yield data are also often limited in the developing world, where future climate impacts may be the most critical.  Second, only process-based models can capture the growth response to elevated CO$_2$, novel conditions that are not represented in historical data \citep[e.g.][]{pugh_climate_2016, Roberts2017}. Similarly process-based models can represent novel changes in management practices (e.g.\ fertilizer input) that may ameliorate climate-induced damages.

%The overall goal of this study is a better understanding of global crop model response to the major drivers in a climate change context. Most previous climate-change-focused global crop modeling studies have simulated model response to representative concentration pathways (RCPs). RCPs are likely to have strong covariance between precipitation, temperature and CO$_2$ that may be hard to decompose statistically. The differences in year-to-year memory in the models and complexity of the changes in year-to-year distributions in weather under RCP scenarios in climate models are complications we seek to control for with this study.  We propose to test the response to major drivers and their interaction by isolating individual input drivers through simulations on first-moment shifts applied to the historical climatology instead of RCP simulations. As emulators are a fundamentally a distillation of the process-based model down to its major drivers, the same applied to their development. 

Statistical emulation of crop simulations has been used to combine advantageous features of both statistical and process-based models. The statistical representation of complicated numerical simulation \citep[e.g.][]{OHAGAN2006, OHAGAN2010}, in which simulation output acts as the training data for a statistical model, has been of increasing interest with the growth of simulation complexity and volume of output. Such emulators or ``surrogate models'' have been used in a variety of fields including hydrology \citep[e.g.][]{Razavi2012}, engineering \citep[e.g.][]{STORLIE2009}, environmental sciences \citep[e.g.][]{RATTO2012}, and climate \citep[e.g.][]{Castruccio14, Holden2014}. For agricultural impacts studies, emulation of process-based models allows exploring crop yields in regions outside ranges of current cultivation and with input variables outside historical precedents, in a lightweight, flexible form that is compatible with economic studies. 

In the past decade, many studies have developed emulators of crop yields from process-based models. Early studies proposing or describing potential emulators include \citet{Howden2005, raisen2006} and \citet{Lobell2010}. In an early application, \citet{Ferrise2011} used a Artificial Neural Net trained on simulation outputs to predict wheat yields in the Mediterranean. Studies developing single-model emulators include  \citet{Holzkamper2012} for the CropSyst model, \citet{RUANE2013a} for the CERES wheat model, \citet{Oyebamiji15} for the LPJmL model (for multiple crops, using multiple scenarios as a training set). In recent years, emulators have begun to be used in the context of multi-model intercomparisons, with \citet{BLANC2015, BLANC2017, Ostberg2018} and \citet{Mistry2017} using them to analyze the five crop models of the Inter-Sectoral Impacts Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) \citep{Warszawski3228} (for maize, soy, wheat, and rice). Approaches differ: \citet{BLANC2015} and \citet{BLANC2017} used local weather variables (and CO$_2$ values) and yields but emulate across soil types using historical simulations and a future climate scenario (RCP8.5 over multiple climate models); \citet{Ostberg2018} used global mean temperature change (and CO$_2$) as regressors but pattern-scale to emulate local yields using multiple climate scenarios; \citet{Mistry2017} used local weather and yields and a historical simulation and compare with data. 

Those emulation studies all utilized time-evolving runs from climate RCP runs and attempt to untangle correlations between the sensitivities to input drivers to crop models. The differences in year-to-year memory in the process-based crop models and the complexity of the changes in distributions in yearly weather under RCP scenarios in climate models are two complications we seek to control for with this study. Additional recent efforts have been made to generate datasets that allow more systematic sampling of the input variable space (also the focus of this study): \citet{Markowski2015} for temperature, CO$_2$, and nitrogen, \citet{Pirttioja2015} and \citet{Snyder2018} for temperature, water, and CO$_2$, and \citep{FRONZEK20182} for temperature and water, with all studies simulating selected sites for a limited number of crops. The parameter sweep approach simplifies the emulator development because it controls for higher frequency effects in the year-to-year variability, and isolate the broad climatological response. The use of limited input parameter space or restricted geographic scope in previous work may impede the ability to build future projections and to understand interaction effects in global process-based crop models. 

The Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison (GGCMI) Phase II experiment seeks to provide a comprehensive global dataset to allow systematically exploring how process-based crop models for the major crop respond to the main climate and management drivers and their interactions. The experiment involves running a suite of process-based crop models across historical conditions perturbed by a set of defined input parameters, and was conducted as part of the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) \citep{ROSENZWEIG2013, Rosenzweig2014}, an international effort conducted under a framework similar to the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) \citep{Taylor2012, Eyring2016}. The GGCMI protocol builds on the AgMIP Coordinated Climate-Crop Modeling Project (C3MP) \citep{ruane2014, mcdermid2015} and will contribute to the AgMIP Coordinated Global and Regional Assessments (CGRA) \citep{ruane2018, rosenzweig2018}. 

GGCMI Phase II is designed to allow addressing goals such as understanding where highest-yield regions may shift under climate change; exploring future adaptive management strategies; understanding how interacting parameters affect crop yield; quantifying uncertainties across models and major drivers; and testing strategies for producing lightweight emulators of process-based models. In this paper, we describe the GGCMI Phase II experiments, summarize output and present initial results, demonstrate that it is tractable to emulation, and present a simple climatological emulator as a potential tool for impacts assessments.

\section{Materials and Methods}
\label{S:2}
\subsection{GGCMI Phase II: experiment design}
GGCMI Phase II is the continuation of a multi-model comparison exercise begun in 2014. The initial Phase I compared harmonized yields of 21 models for 19 crops over a historical (1980-2010) scenario with a primary goal of model evaluation \citep{Elliott2015, muller_global_2017}. Phase II compares simulations of 12 models for 5 crops (maize, rice, soybean, spring wheat, and winter wheat) over hundreds of scenarios in which individual climate or management inputs are adjusted from their historical values. The reduced set of crops includes the three major global cereals and the major legume and accounts for over 50\% of human calories (in 2016, nearly 3.5 billion tons or 32\% of total global crop production by weight \citep{FAOSTAT}.

 \caption{Models included in the GGCMI Phase II and the number of C, T, W, and N simulations performed for rain-fed crops (``Sims per Crop''), with 672 as the maximum. ``N-Dim.'' indicates if simulations include varying nitrogen levels; two models omit this dimension. All models provided the same set of simulations across all modeled crops, but some omitted individual crops in some cases. (For example, APSIM did not simulate winter wheat.) Irrigated simulations are provided at the level of the other covariates for each model (for an additional 84 simulations for the fully-sampled models). Geographic extent of simulation varies to some extent within a certain model for different scenarios (672 rain-fed simulations does not necessarily equal 672 climatological yields in all areas). This geographic variance only applies for areas far outside the area of currently cultivated crops. Two models (marked with *) use non-AgMERRA climate inputs. For further details on models, see \citet{Elliott2015}. \dag PROMET provided simulations at only two nitrogen levels so is not emulated across the nitrogen dimension.} 
\label{table:models}
\end{table*}

The major goals of GGCMI Phase II are to:
\begin{itemize}
  \setlength\itemsep{0.3mm}
    \item Enhance understanding of how models work by characterizing their sensitivity to input climate and nitrogen drivers.
    \item Study the interactions between climate variables and nitrogen inputs in driving modeled yield impacts. 
    \item Explore differences in crop response to warming across the Earth's climate regions.
    \item Provide a dataset that allows statistical emulation of crop model responses for downstream modelers.
    \item Illustrate differences in potential adaptation via growing season changes. 
\end{itemize}

The guiding scientific rationale of GGCMI Phase II is to provide a comprehensive, systematic evaluation of the response of process-based crop models to different values for carbon dioxide, temperature, water, and applied nitrogen (collectively known as ``CTWN''). Phase II of the GGCMI project consists of a series of simulations, each with one or more of the CTWN dimensions perturbed over the 31-year historical time series (1980-2010) used in Phase I. In most cases, historical daily climate inputs are taken from the 0.5 degree NASA AgMERRA daily gridded re-analysis product specifically designed for agricultural modeling, with satellite-corrected precipitation \citep{Ruane2015}. Two models require sub-daily input data and use alternative sources. See \citet{Elliott2015} for additional details. 

The experimental protocol consists of 9 levels for precipitation perturbations, 7 for temperature, 4 for CO$_2$, and 3 for applied nitrogen, for a total of 672 simulations for rain-fed agriculture and an additional 84 for irrigated (Table \ref{table:inputs}). For irrigated simulations, soil water is held at either field capacity or, for those models that include water-log damage, at maximum beneficial level.  Temperature perturbations are applied as absolute offsets from the daily mean, minimum, and maximum temperature time series for each grid cell used as inputs. Precipitation perturbations are applied as fractional changes at the grid cell level, and carbon dioxide and nitrogen levels are specified as discrete values applied uniformly over all grid cells. Note that CO$_2$ changes are applied independently of changes in climate variables, so that higher CO$_2$ is not associated with higher temperatures. An additional, identical set of scenarios (at the same C, T, W, and N levels) simulate adaptive agronomy under climate change by varying the growing season for crop production. (These adaptation simulations are not shown or analyzed here.) The resulting GGCMI data set captures a distribution of crop responses over the potential space of future climate conditions.

The 12 models included in GGCMI Phase II are all mechanistic process-based crop models that are widely used in impacts assessments (Table \ref{table:models}). Although some of the models shares a common base (e.g. LPJmL and LPJ-GUESS and the EPIC models), they have developed independently from this shared base, for more details on the genealogy of the models see Figure S1 in \citet{Rosenzweig2014}. Differences in model structure does mean that several key factors are not standardized across the experiment, including secondary soil nutrients, carry over effects across growing years including residue management and soil moisture, and extent of simulated area for different crops. Growing seasons are identical across models, but vary by crop and by location on the globe. All stresses except factors related to nitrogen, temperature, and water (e.g. Alkalinity, salinity) are disabled. No additional nitrogen inputs, such as atmospheric deposition, are considered, but some models have individual assumptions on soil organic matter that may release additional nitrogen through mineralization. See \citet{Rosenzweig2014}, \citet{Elliott2015} and \citet{muller_global_2017} for further details on models and underlying assumptions.

Each model is run at 0.5 degree spatial resolution and covers all currently cultivated areas and much of the uncultivated land area.  Coverage extends considerably outside currently cultivated areas because cultivation will likely shift under climate change. See Figure \ref{fig:crop_area} for the present-day cultivated area of rain-fed crops, and Figure \ref{fig:irrarea} in the supplemental material for irrigated crops. Some areas such as Greenland, far-northern Canada, Siberia, Antarctica, the Gobi and Sahara deserts, and central Australia are not simulated as they are assumed to remain non-arable even under an extreme climate change. Growing seasons are standardized across models with data adapted from several sources \citep{Sacks2010, Portmann2008, Portmann2010}.

The participating modeling groups provide simulations at any of four initially specified levels of participation, so the number of simulations varies by model, with some sampling only a part of the experiment variable space. Most modeling groups simulate all five crops in the protocol, but some omitted one or more. Table \ref{table:models} provides details of coverage for each model. Note that the three models that provide less than 50 simulations are excluded from the emulator analysis. 

All models produce as output, crop yields (tons ha$^{-1}$ year$^{-1}$) for each 0.5 degree grid cell. Because both yields and yield changes vary substantially across models and across grid cells, we primarily analyze relative change from a baseline. We take as the baseline the scenario with historical climatology (i.e.\ T and P changes of 0). C of 360 ppm, and applied N at 200 kg ha$^-1$.  We show absolute yields in some cases to illustrate geographic differences in yields for a single model. 

\subsection{Simulation model validation approach}
To verify the skill of the process-based models used, we repeat the validation exercises presented in \citet{muller_global_2017} for GGCMI Phase I. Note however that the GGCMI Phase II simulations are designed for evaluating changes in yield but not absolute yields, and so omit the calibrations used in predicting modeling to account for cultivar, pest loss, and management differences. The Phase II simulations also do not reproduce realistic nitrogen application levels for individual countries, since nitrogen is one of the parameters systematically varied. The \citet{muller_global_2017} validation procedure evaluates response to year-to-year temperature and precipitation variations in a control run driven by historical climate and compares it to detrended historical yields from the FAO \citep{FAOSTAT} by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient. The procedure offers no means of assessing CO2 fertilization, since CO2 has been relatively constant over the historical data collection period. Nitrogen data are limited for many countries, and as mentioned the GGCMI Phase II runs impose fixed and uniform nitrogen application, introducing some uncertainty into the analysis. We evaluate one or more control runs for each model, since some modeling groups provide historical runs for three different nitrogen levels.

We show responses of a single crop (rain-fed maize) to applied uniform temperature perturbations, for three discrete precipitation perturbation levels (rain-fed (rf) -20\%, rain-fed (0), and rain-fed +20\%), with CO$_2$ and nitrogen held constant at baseline values (360 pmm and 200 kg ha$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$).

Panel text gives the percentage of rain-fed maize presently cultivated in each climate zone \citep[data from][]{Portmann2010}. Box-and-whiskers plots show distribution across models, with median marked. Box edges are first and third quartiles, i.e.\ box height is the interquartile range (IQR). Whiskers extend to maximum and minimum of simulations but are limited at 1.5$\cdot$IQR; otherwise the outlier is shown. Models generally agree in most climate regions (other than cold continental), with projected changes larger than inter-model variance. Outliers in the tropics (strong negative impact of temperature increases) are the pDSSAT model; outliers in the high-rainfall case (strong positive impact of precipitation increases) are the JULES model. Inter-model variance increases in the case where precipitation is reduced, suggesting uncertainty in model response to water limitation. The right panel with global changes shows yield responses to an globally uniform temperature shift; note that these results are not directly comparable to simulations of more realistic climate scenarios with the same global mean change.}

\end{figure*}

%This is a conservative approach driven by the relative uncertainties surrounding the future climate projections. First moment projections in temperature are fundamentally made from an energy balance standpoint, while changes in variability are made from a dynamics standpoint. If we are projecting mean changes in climate, we should build damage functions from mean changes in climate. If we are projecting mean changes in climate, we should build damage functions from mean changes in climate. 

To demonstrate the properties of the GGCMI Phase II dataset, we construct an emulator of 30-year climatological mean yields, which are of most interest to impact modelers. This approach differs from previous studies of crop model emulation, which have typically emulated at the annual level. Annual emulation is required when the input training set consists of non-stationary projections of evolving yields (such as an RCP run). Recent studies \citep[e.g.][]{FRONZEK20182, Snyder2018} that used a training set of stationary simulations with fixed variations in parameters allow emulating the climatological mean response instead. The two can differ for multiple reasons, including any year-to-year memory in the crop model, or if the distribution of growing-season daily temperatures associated with interannual variability is different from that associated with long-term CO2-driven changes. The confounding of year-to-year response with climatological response might be considered a class of Simpson's paradox. Crop yields in process based models do not respond to the mean growing season temperature, they respond the the \texit{exact} distribution in temperature over the growing season (or, specifically the exact temperature time series). Much of the variance is left unexplained if one tries to fit a statistical model between yields and some aggregate temperature variable (mean growing season temperature, monthly temperature etc.). Application of relationships obtained from such statistical models to mean changes in climate may provide problematic. The year-over-year yield response to individual factors in GGCMI Phase II do in fact often exceeds the climatological response (Figure \ref{fig:yearvclim}). Note that the GGCMI Phase II datasets will not capture distributional shifts, because all simulations are run with fixed offsets from the historical climatology. (For methods to generate adjust historical climate data inclusive of distributional changes, see XX and XX). Emulation approaches are an area of active ongoing study and one of the goals of the GGCMI Phase II dataset is to facilitate these efforts. 

Emulation involves fitting individual regression models for each crop, simulation model, and 0.5 degree geographic pixel from the GGCMI Phase II data set. The regressors are the applied constant perturbations in temperature, water, nitrogen and CO$_2$, we aggregate the simulation outputs in the time dimension, and regress on the 30-year mean yields. (See Figure \ref{fig:yearly} for illustration). The regression therefore omits information about yield responses to year-to-year climate perturbations, which are more complex. Emulating inter-annual yield variations would likely require considering statistical details of the historical climate time series, including changes in marginal distribution and temporal dependencies. (Future work should explore this). The climatological emulation indirectly includes any yield response to geographically distributed factors such as soil type, insolation, and the baseline climate itself, because we construct separate emulators for each grid cell. The emulator parameter matrices are portable and the yield computations are cheap even at the half-degree grid cell resolution, so we do not aggregate in space at this time.

We regress climatological mean yields against a third-order polynomial in C, T, W, and N with interaction terms. The higher-order terms are necessary to capture any nonlinear responses, which are well-documented in observations for temperature and water perturbations (e.g.\ \citet{Schlenker2009} for T and \citet{He2016} for W). We include interaction terms (both linear and higher-order) because past studies have shown them to be significant effects. For example, \citet{Lobell2007} and \citet{Tebaldi2008} showed that in real-world yields, the joint distribution in T and W is needed to explain observed yield variance. (C and N are fixed in these data.) Other observation-based studies have shown the importance of the interaction between water and nitrogen \citep[e.g.][]{AULAKH2005}, and between nitrogen and carbon dioxide \citep{Mitsuru92, Nakamura97}. We do not focus on comparing different functional forms in this study, and instead choose a relatively simple parametrization that allows for some interpretation of coefficients. Some prior studies have used more complex functional forms and larger numbers of parameters, e.g. 39 in \citet{BLANC2015} and \citet{BLANC2017}, who borrow information across space by fitting grid points simultaneously across a large region in a panel regression. {\color{red}We choose a simpler emulation at grid-cell level to avoid the requirement of assuming responses are uniform across space and to maximize interpretability.}

The limited GGCMI variable sample space means that use of the full polynomial expression described above, which has 34 terms for the rain-fed case (12 for irrigated), can be problematic, and can lead to over-fitting and unstable parameter estimations. We therefore reduce the number of terms through a feature selection cross-validation process in which terms in the polynomial are tested for importance. In this procedure higher-order and interaction terms are added successively to the model; we then follow the reduction of the the aggregate mean squared error with increasing terms and eliminate those terms that do not contribute significant reductions. See supplemental documents for more details. We select terms by applying the feature selection process to the three models that provided the complete set of 672 rain-fed simulations (pDSSAT, EPIC-TAMU, and LPJmL); the resulting choice of terms is then applied for all emulators. 

Feature importance is remarkably consistent across all three models and across all crops (see Figure \ref{fig:featureselection} in the supplemental material). The feature selection process results in a final polynomial in 23 terms, with 11 terms eliminated. We omit the N$^3$ term, which cannot be fitted because we sample only three nitrogen levels. We eliminate many of the C terms: the cubic, the CT, CTN, and CWN interaction terms, and all higher order interaction terms in C.  Finally, we eliminate two 2nd-order interaction terms in T and one in W. Implication of this choice include that nitrogen interactions are complex and important, and that water interaction effects are more nonlinear than those in temperature. The resulting statistical model (Equation \ref{eqn:features_final}) is used for all grid cells, models, and crops: 

\begin{align}
    \label{eqn:features_final}
    Y\ = \ & K_{1}  \\
       + \ & K_{2}  C     + K_{3}  T     + K_{4}  W     + K_{5}  N   \nonumber \\

       + \ & K_{10} C W   + K_{11} C N   + K_{12} T W   + K_{13} T N + K_{14} W N \nonumber \\ % lost 1 term, CT
       + \ & K_{15} T^3   + K_{16} W^3   + K_{17} T W N  \nonumber \\ % lost 2 terms, C^3 and N^3

\end{align}

To fit the parameters $K$, we use a Bayesian Ridge probabilistic estimator \citep{MacKay91}, which reduces volatility in parameter estimates when the sampling is sparse, by weighting parameter estimates towards zero. The Bayesian Ridge method is necessary to maintain a consistent functional form across all models, and locations as the linear least squares fails to provide a stable result in many cases. In the GGCMI Phase II experiment, the most problematic fits are those for models that provided a limited number of cases or for low-yield geographic regions where some modeling groups did not run all scenarios. Because we do not attempt to emulate models that provided less than 50 simulations, the lowest number of simulations emulated across the full parameter space is 130 (for the PEPIC model). We use the implementation of the Bayesian Ridge estimator from the scikit-learn package in Python \citep{scikit-learn}. 

The resulting parameter matrices for all crop model emulators are available on request, as are the raw simulation data and a Python application to emulate yields. The yield output for a single GGCMI model that simulates all scenarios and all five crops is $\sim$12.5 GB; the emulator is $\sim$100 MB, a reduction by over two orders of magnitude.

Hatching indicates areas of low confidence ($\Delta < 1 \sigma$), and stippling areas of medium confidence ($1 \sigma < \Delta < 2 \sigma$). Crop model results in cold areas, where yield impacts are on average positive, also have the highest uncertainty.}
   \label{fig:maizesoybaseline}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Emulator evaluation}
Because no general criteria exist for defining an acceptable model emulator, we develop a metric of emulator performance specific to GGCMI. For a multi-model comparison exercise like GGCMI, a reasonable criterion is what we term the ``normalized error'', which compares the fidelity of an emulator for a given model and scenario to the inter-model uncertainty. We define the normalized error $e$ for each scenario as the difference between the fractional yield change from the emulator and that in the original simulation, divided by the standard deviation of the multi-model spread (Equations \ref{eqn:per_yield} and  \ref{eqn:error}):

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:per_yield}
    F_{\: scn.}=\frac{Y_{scn.}-Y_{baseline}}{Y_{baseline}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:error}
    e_{\: scn.} =\frac{F_{em, \: scn.}-F_{sim, \: scn.}}{\sigma_{sim, \: scn.}}
\end{equation}

Here $F_{\: scn.}$ is the fractional change in a model's mean emulated or simulated yield from a defined baseline, in some scenario (scn.) in C, T, W, and N space; $Y_{scn.}$ and $Y_{baseline}$ are the absolute emulated or simulated mean yields. The normalized error $e$ is the difference between the emulated fractional change in yield and that actually simulated, normalized by $\sigma_{sim}$, the standard deviation in simulated fractional yields $F_{sim,\: scn.}$ across all models. The emulator is fit across all available simulation outputs, and then the error is calculated across the simulation scenarios provided by all nine models (Figure \ref{fig:error_360} and Figures \ref{fig:error360total} and Figures \ref{fig:error810} in supplemental documents). Note that the normalized error $e$ for a model depends not only on the fidelity of its emulator in reproducing a given simulation but on the particular suite of models considered in the intercomparison exercise. The rationale for this choice is to relate the fidelity of the emulation to an estimate of true uncertainty, which we take as the multi-model spread. 

\section{Results}
\label{S:3}
\subsection{Simulation results}
Crop models in the GGCMI ensemble show a broadly consistent responses to climate and management perturbations in most regions, with a strong negative impact of increased temperature in all but the coldest regions. We illustrate this result for rain-fed maize in Figure \ref{fig:globesim}, which shows yields for the primary K\"{o}ppen-Geiger climate regions \citep{rubel2010}. In warming scenarios, models show decreases in maize yield in the temperate, tropical, and arid regions that account for nearly three-quarters of global maize production. These impacts are robust for even moderate climate perturbations. In the temperate zone, even a 1 degree temperature rise with other variables held fixed leads to a median yield reduction that outweighs the variance across models. A 6 degree temperature rise results in median loss of $\sim$25\% of yields with a signal to noise of nearly three. A notable exception is the cold continental region, where models disagree strongly, extending even to the sign of impacts. Model simulations of other crops produce similar responses to warming, with robust yield losses in warmer locations and high inter-model variance in the cold continental regions (Figures \ref{fig:KGcrops_all}).

The effects of rainfall changes on maize yields are also as expected and are consistent across models. Increased rainfall mitigates the negative effect of higher temperatures, most strongly in arid regions. Decreased rainfall amplifies yield losses and also increases inter-model variance more strongly, suggesting that models have difficulty representing crop response to water stress.  We show only rain-fed maize here; see Figure \ref{fig:KGirr_all} for the irrigated case. As expected, irrigated crops are more resilient to temperature increases in all regions, especially so where water is limiting.  

Mapping the distribution of baseline yields and yield changes shows the geographic dependencies that underlie these results. Figure \ref{fig:maizesoybaseline} shows baseline and changes in the T+4 scenario for rain-fed maize, soy, and rice in the multi-model ensemble mean, with locations of model agreement marked.Absolute yield potentials are have strong spatial variation, with much of the Earth's surface area unsuitable for any given crop. In general, models agree most on yield response in regions where yield potentials are currently high and therefore where crops are currently grown. Models show robust decreases in yields at low latitudes, and highly uncertain median increases at most high latitudes. For wheat crops see Figure \ref{fig:wheatbaseline}; wheat projections are both more uncertain and show fewer areas of increased yield in the inter-model mean. 

\subsection{Simulation model validation results}
\begin{figure*}[!htb]

    \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/Agformet_validation.png}
    \caption{Time series correlation coefficients between simulated crop yield and FAO data \citep{FAOSTAT} at the country level. The top panels indicate two example cases: US maize (a good case), and rice in India (mixed case), both for the high nitrogen application case. The heatmaps illustrate the Pearson $r$ correlation coefficient between the detrended simulation mean yield at the country level compared to the detrended FAO yield data for the top producing countries for each crop with continuous FAO data over the 1980-2010 period. Models that provided different nitrogen application levels are shown with low, med, and high label (models that did not simulated different nitrogen levels are analogous to a high nitrogen application level). The ensemble mean yield is also correlated with the FAO data (not the mean of the correlations). Wheat contains both spring wheat and winter wheat simulations.}
    \label{fig:simulation_val}
\end{figure*}

{\color{blue} Figure \ref{fig:simulation_val} shows the Pearson time series correlation between the simulation model yield and FOA yield data. Figure \ref{fig:simulation_val} can be compared to Figures 1,2,3,4 and 6 in \citet{muller_global_2017}. The results are mixed, with many regions for rice and wheat being difficult to model. No single model is dominant, with each model providing near best-in-class performance in at least one location-crop combination. The presence of very few vertical dark green color bars clearly illustrates the power of a multi-model intercomparison project like the one presented here. The ensemble mean does not beat the best model in each case, but shows positive correlation in over 75\% of the cases presented here. The EPIC-TAMU model performs best for soy, CARIAB, EPIC-TAMU, and PEPIC perform best for maize, PROMET performs best for wheat, and the EPIC family of models perform best for rice. Reductions in skill over the performance illustrated in \citet{muller_global_2017} can be attributed to the nitrogen levels or lack of calibration in some models.

Soy is qualitatively the easiest crop to represent (except in Argentina), which is likely due in part to the invariance of the response to nitrogen application (soy fixes atmospheric nitrogen very efficiently). Comparison to the FAO data is therefore easier than the other crops because the nitrogen application levels do not matter. US maize has the best performance across models, with nearly every model representing the historical variability to a reasonable extent. Especially good example years for US maize are 1983, 1988, and 2004 (top left panel of Figure \ref{fig:simulation_val}), where every model gets the direction of the anomaly compared to surrounding years correct. 1983 and 1988 are famously bad years for US maize along with 2012 (not shown). US maize is possibly both the most uniformly industrialized (in terms of management practices) crop and the one with the best data collection in the historical period of all the cases presented here.

The FAO data is at least one level of abstraction from ground truth in many cases, especially in developing countries. The failure of models to represent the year-to-year variability in rice in some countries in southeast Asia is likely partly due to model failure and partly due to lack of data. It is possible to speculate that the difference in performance between Pakistan (no successful models) and India (many successful models) for rice may reside at least in part in the FAO data and not the models themselves. The same might apply to Bangladesh and India for rice. Partitioning of these contributions is impossible at this stage. Additionally, there is less year-to-year variability in rice yields (partially due to the fraction of irrigated cultivation). Since the Pearson r metric is scale invariant, it will tend to score the rice models more poorly than maize and soy. An example of very poor performance can be seen with the pDSSAT model for rice in India (top right panel of Figure \ref{fig:simulation_val}).}

The inter-model standard deviation is larger for the perturbations in CO$_2$ and nitrogen than for those in temperature or precipitation illustrating that the sensitivity to weather is better constrained than to management at elevated CO$_2$. While most model responses can readily emulated with a simple polynomial, some response surfaces are more complicated and lead to emulation error.}
   \label{fig:regression_iowa}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Emulator performance}
Emulation provides not only a computational tool but a means of understanding and interpreting crop yield response across the parameter space. Emulation is only possible, however, when crop yield responses are sufficiently smooth and continuous to allow fitting with a relatively simple functional form. In the GGCMI simulations, this condition largely but not always holds. Responses are quite diverse across locations, crops, and models, but in most cases local responses are regular enough to permit emulation. Figure \ref{fig:regression} illustrates the geographic diversity of responses even in high-yield areas for a single crop and model (rain-fed maize in pDSSAT for various high-cultivation areas).  This heterogeneity validates the choice of emulating at the grid cell level. 

Each panel in Figure \ref{fig:regression} shows model yield output from scenarios varying only along a single dimension (CO$_2$, temperature, precipitation, or nitrogen addition), with other inputs held fixed at baseline levels; in all cases yields evolve smoothly across the space sampled. For reference we show the results of the full emulation fitted across the parameter space. The polynomial fit readily captures the climatological response to perturbations.

Crop yield responses generally follow similar functional forms across models, though with a spread in magnitude. Figure \ref{fig:regression_iowa} illustrates the inter-model diversity of yield responses to the same perturbations, even for a single crop and location (rain-fed maize in northern Iowa, the same location shown in the Figure \ref{fig:regression}). The differences make it important to construct emulators separately for each individual model, and the fidelity of emulation can also differ across models. This figure illustrates a common phenomenon, that models differ more in response to perturbations in CO$_2$ and nitrogen perturbations than to those in temperature or precipitation. (Compare also Figures \ref{fig:globesim} and \ref{fig:carbon}.) For this location and crop, CO$_2$ fertilization effects can range from $\sim$5--50\%, and nitrogen responses from nearly flat to a 60\% drop in the lowest-application simulation. 

While the nitrogen dimension is important and uncertain, it is also the most problematic to emulate in this work because of its limited sampling. The GGCMI protocol specified only three nitrogen levels (10, 60 and 200 kg~N y$^{-1}$ ha$^{-1}$), so a third-order fit would be over-determined but a second-order fit can result in potentially unphysical results. Steep and nonlinear declines in yield with lower nitrogen levels means that some regressions imply a peak in yield between the 100 and 200 kg~N y$^{-1}$ ha$^{-1}$ levels. While there may be some reason to believe over-application of nitrogen at the wrong time in the growing season could lead to reduced yields, these features are almost certainly an artifact of under sampling.In addition, the polynomial fit cannot capture the well-documented saturation effect of nitrogen application \citep[e.g.][]{Torsten77} as accurately as would be possible with a non-parametric model.

White areas are those where crops are not simulated by this model. Models differ in their areas omitted, meaning the number of samples used to calculate the multi-model standard deviation is not spatially consistent in all locations. Emulator performance is generally good relative to model spread in areas where crops are currently cultivated (compare to Figure 1) and in temperate zones in general; emulation issues occur primarily in marginal areas with low yield potentials. For CARAIB, emulation of soy is more problematic, as was also shown in Figure \ref{fig:error_360}.}
   \label{fig:error}
\end{figure}

To assess the ability of the polynomial emulation to capture the behavior of complex process-based models, we evaluate the normalized emulator error. That is, for each grid cell, model, and scenario we evaluate the difference between the model yield and its emulation, normalized by the inter-model standard deviation in yield projections. This metric implies that emulation is generally satisfactory, with several distinct exceptions. Almost all model-crop combination emulators have normalized errors less than one over nearly all currently cultivated hectares (Figure \ref{fig:error_360}), but some individual model-crop combinations are problematic (e.g.\ PROMET for rice and soy, JULES for soy and winter wheat, Figures \ref{fig:errorjules}--\ref{fig:errorpromet}). Normalized errors for soy are somewhat higher across all models not because emulator fidelity is worse but because models agree more closely on yield changes for soy than for other crops (see Figure \ref{fig:temperature}, lowering the denominator. Emulator performance often degrades in geographic locations where crops are not currently cultivated. Figure \ref{fig:error} shows a CARAIB case as an example, where emulator performance is satisfactory over cultivated areas for all crops other than soy, but uncultivated regions show some problematic areas. 

It should be noted that this assessment metric is relatively forgiving. First, each emulation is evaluated against the simulation actually used to train the emulator. Had we used a spline interpolation the error would necessarily be zero. Second, the performance metric scales emulator fidelity not by the magnitude of yield changes but by the inter-model spread in those changes. Where models differ more widely, the standard for emulators becomes less stringent. Because models disagree on the magnitude of CO$_2$ fertilization, this effect is readily seen when comparing assessments of emulator performance in simulations at  baseline CO$_2$ (Figure \ref{fig:error_360}) with those at higher CO$_2$ levels (Figure \ref{fig:error810}). Widening the inter-model spread leads to an apparent increase in emulator skill.

\subsection{Emulator applications}
Because the emulator or ``surrogate model'' transforms the discrete simulation sample space into a continuous response surface at any geographic scale, it can be used for a variety of applications. Emulators provide a easy way to compare a ensembles of climate or impacts projections. They also provide a means for generating continuous damage functions. As an example, we show a damage function constructed from 4D emulations for aggregated yield at the global scale, for maize on currently cultivated land, with simulated values shown for comparison. (Figure \ref{fig:globe_em};  see Figures \ref{fig:temperature}- \ref{fig:nitrogen} in the supplemental material for other crops and dimensions.) The emulated values closely match simulations even at this aggregation level. Note that these functions are presented only as examples and do not represent true global projections, because they are developed from simulation data with a uniform temperature shift while increases in global mean temperature should manifest non-uniformly. The global coverage of the GGCMI simulations allows impacts modelers to apply arbitrary geographically-varying climate projections, as well as arbitrary aggregation mask, to develop damage functions for any climate scenario and any geopolitical or geographic level.

Lines are emulations for rain-fed (solid) and irrigated (dashed) crops; for comparison, dots are the simulated values for the rain-fed case.  For most models, irrigated crops show a sharper reduction than do rain-fed because of the locations of cultivated areas: irrigated crops tend to be grown in warmer areas where impacts are more severe for a given temperature shift.

\section{Conclusions and discussion} 
\label{S:4}
The GGCMI Phase II experiment provides a database targeted to allow detailed study of crop yields from process-based models under climate change. The experiment is designed to facilitate not only comparing the sensitivities of process-based crop yield models to changing climate and management inputs but also evaluating the complex interactions between driving factors (CO$_2$, temperature, precipitation, and applied nitrogen). Its global nature also allows identifying geographic shifts in high yield potential locations.  We expect that the simulations will yield multiple insights in future studies, and show here a selection of preliminary results to illustrate their potential uses. 

First, the GGCMI Phase II simulations allow identifying major areas of uncertainty. Across the major crops, inter-model uncertainty is greatest for wheat and least for soy. Across factors impacting yields, inter-model uncertainty is largest for CO$_2$ fertilization and nitrogen response effects. Across geographic regions, projections are most uncertain in the high latitudes where yields may increase, and most robust in low latitudes where yield impacts are largest.  

Second, the GGCMI Phase II simulations allow understanding the way that climate-driven changes and locations of cultivated land combine to produce yield impacts. One counterintuitive result immediate apparent is that irrigated maize shows steeper yield reductions under warming than does rain-fed maize when considered only over currently cultivated land. The effect results from geographic differences in cultivation. In any given location, irrigation increases crop resiliency to temperature increase, but irrigated maize is grown in warmer locations where the impacts of warming are more severe (Figures \ref{fig:KGirr_all}--\ref{fig:KGirr_currentcult}). The same behavior holds for rice and winter wheat, but not for soy or spring wheat (Figures \ref{fig:rice_currentcult}-\ref{fig:winter_wheat_currentcult}). Irrigated wheat and maize are also more sensitive to nitrogen fertilization levels than are analogous non-irritated crops, presumably because those rain-fed crops are limited by water as well as nitrogen availability (Figure \ref{fig:nitrogen}). (Soy as an efficient atmospheric nitrogen-fixer is relatively insensitive to nitrogen, and rice is not generally grown in water-limited conditions).

Third, we show that even the relatively limited GGCMI Phase II sampling space allows emulation of the climatological response of crop models with a relatively simple reduced-form statistical model. The systematic parameter sampling in the GGCMI Phase II procedure provides information on the influence of multiple interacting factors in a way that single projections cannot, and emulating the resulting response surface then produces a tool that can aid in both physical interpretation of the process-based models and in assessment of agricultural impacts under arbitrary climate scenarios. Emulating the climatological response isolates long-term impacts from any confounding factors that complicate year-over-year changes, and the use of simple functional forms offer the possibility of physical interpretation of parameter values. Care should be taken in applying relationships developed at the yearly level to shifts in the mean climatology. shifts. More work is required to better understand how changes in the distributions in weather might affect yields in the future. We anticipate that systematic parameter sampling will become the norm in future model intercomparison exercise.

While the GGCMI Phase II database should offer the foundation for multiple future studies, several cautions need to be noted. Because the simulation protocol was designed to focus on change in yield under climate perturbations and not on replicating real-world yields, the models are not formally calibrated so cannot be used for impacts projections unless in used in conjunction with historical data (or data products). Because the GGCMI simulations apply uniform perturbations to historical climate inputs, they do not sample changes in higher order moments, and cannot address the additional crop yield impacts of potential changes in climate variability. Although distributional changes in model projections are fairly uncertain at present, follow-on experiments may wish to consider them. Several recent studies have described procedures for generating simulations that combine historical data with model projections of not only mean changes in temperature and precipitation but changes in their marginal distributions (cite) or temporal dependence ().

--- NEEDS EDIT -- still there’s lots of future work can be done even with this  database--- 

Detailed examination of interaction terms between the major input drivers. More robust quantification of the sensitivity of different models to the input drivers. Comparison with field-level experimental data can then aid in model evaluation. As mentioned previously, database allows study of geographic shifts in optimal growing regions for different crops. The output dataset also contains other runs and variables not analyzed or shown here. Runs include several which allowed adaptation to climate changes by altering growing seasons, and additional variables include above ground biomass, LAI, and root biomass (as many as 25 output variables for some models). Emulation studies that are possible include study of year-over-year vs climatological emulation, and more systematic evaluation of different statistical model specifications and formal calculation of uncertainties in derived parameters.

% -- summing up paragrah – NEEDS EDIT -- make this not sound like this paper is the end-all answer
The future of food security is one of the larger challenges facing humanity at present. The development of multi-model ensembles such as GGCMI Phase II provides a way to begin to quantify uncertainties in crop responses to a range of potential climate inputs and explore the potential benefits of adaptive responses. 

%Emulation also allow making state-of-the-art simulation results available to a wide research community as simple, computationally tractable tools that can be used by downstream modelers to understand the socioeconomic impacts of crop response to climate change.

% notes from Liz

%there are a lot of results in Conclusions/Discussion, some of which are only thinly discussed - might get asked to move them or justify more. (Unless you moved these already)

%- why not compare your emulator to statistical models from others?  You might say because models weren't calibrated, but it's a reasonable and may have to be addressed.

%- if we didn't state the irrigated/unirrigated conclusion in the abstract, we should do that

%- on irrigated/unirrigated figures in supp docs - for the currently cultivated land, put the mean temp for the relevant area for irrigated and unirrigated, to back up assertion in paper that there is a temperature difference.

%- We claimed that irrigated damages were higher because damages for a given T change are larger for a given baseline temperature. Is that backed up in the paper? Only indirectly by the maps that show stronger damages in the T+4 case for low latitudes than high latitudes. It could be interesting to do scatterplot of yield changes for a given scenario where the x axis is baseline climate. (Or include two scenarios colored differently...)

%- probably good to explain in more detail that simpler fitting methods can cause problems. Even just a sentence or two in the main manuscript to explain that your choice is better. If you wanted to put in the results of more methodological work, that could work too, either in the main paper or the supp docs. Part of the paper's message is that emulation is possible; it would make sense to explain that it is NOT possible to emulate well if you don't use the right approach.
